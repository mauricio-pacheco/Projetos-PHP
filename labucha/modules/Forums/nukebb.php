 * phpbb2 forums port version 2.1 (c) 2003 - Nuke Cops (http://nukecops.com)
 *
 * Ported by Paul Laudanski (Zhen-Xjell) to phpbb2 standalone 2.0.4.  Test
 * and debugging completed by the Elite Nukers at Nuke Cops: ArtificialIntel,
 * Chatserv, MikeM, sixonetonoffun, Zhen-Xjell.  Thanks to some heavy debug
 * work by AI in Nuke 6.5.
 *
 * You run this package at your sole risk.  Nuke Cops and affiliates cannot
 * be held liable if anything goes wrong.  You are advised to test this
 * package on a development system.  Backup everything before implementing
 * in a production environment.  If something goes wrong, you can always
 * backout and restore your backups.
 *
 * Installing and running this also means you agree to the terms of the AUP 
 * found at Nuke Cops.
 *
 * This is version 2.1 of the phpbb2 forum port for PHP-Nuke.  Work is based
 * on Tom Nitzschner's forum port version 2.0.6.  Tom's 2.0.6 port was based
 * on the phpbb2 standalone version 2.0.3.  Our version 2.1 from Nuke Cops is
 * now reflecting phpbb2 standalone 2.0.4 that fixes some major SQL 
 * injection exploits.
