Journal 2.0
This is a PHPNuke Journal update no database changes are
required for use.

Installation:
I you want to use your forums smiles or some other ones
located within your nuke site you can change the path in
functions.php 
/* Change Smiles Path Here */
$jsmiles = "./modules/Journal/images/moods";
To use Forum Smiles set the path to:
$jsmiles = "./modules/Forums/images/smiles";

Styles have been added to the Journal directory.
This is the structure:
./modules/Journal/styles/theme_name/style.css

READ THIS!
To enable the use of Font changes you must make a copy of
your Themes style.css and remove the line:
FONT		{FONT-FAMILY: Verdana,Helvetica; FONT-SIZE: 11px}
from it and place it in the Journal/styles in a directory with the 
same name as your theme. We included all of the default themes but if 
you have made changes to them you will want to follow this copy 
proceedure so the Journal pages display with the same styles as the 
rest of your site.
