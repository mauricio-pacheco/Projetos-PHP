*** How to install multiple galleries ***

It's possible to have multiple galleries of coppermine in your phpNuke.
1. Upload the content of modules/coppermine to a new folder say: modules/YourGallery there is no need for the coppermine/lang/*  language vars will be from your first install
2. Go to modules/YourGallery/install.php and follow instructions
3. Your second gallery is born :)
4. You may also use the "block-CPG-*" blocks for that gallery copy the file and edit
   $cpg_dir="coppermine"; Change "coppermine" to the other directory name
   (for ex. "YourGallery") NOTICE: The block "CPG Stats" already uses all installs.

WARNING! There is no seperate Group setup yet so be sure both galleries have the same groups. We added multigroup setup to CPG but only the setup works. The functionality for it will be added in next release
