		<H1>Built in File Browser</H1>
		<P>The editor comes with a default, generic, File Browser that is, for now, used by 
			the Link and Image&nbsp;dialog windows (throw the "Browser Server" button). 
			This File Browser offers a <STRONG>unique interface</STRONG> that can be used 
			by all server side languages throw a "Connector" that is based on standard <STRONG>XML</STRONG>
			messages. The developer, when implementing FCKeditor on his site, can decide 
			wich Connector to used based on his server capabilities and preferences.</P>
		<P>Today, there are available Connectors for <STRONG>ASP</STRONG>, <STRONG>PHP</STRONG>
			and <STRONG>ASP.NET</STRONG>.</P>
		<H3>Configuring the Connector</H3>
		<P>All connectors available in the editor package can be found at the following 
			folder: "editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors". Each server side 
			language has its own folder there, with the Connector file inside it. To choose 
			witch connector to use, the&nbsp;developer just edit the configuration file and 
			modify the following key (in this case for the Link Dialog box):</P>
		<code>FCKConfig.<STRONG>LinkBrowserURL</STRONG> = FCKConfig.BasePath + 
			"filemanager/browser/default/browser.html?Connector=<STRONG>connectors/aspx/connector.aspx</STRONG>" 
			;</code>
		<P>The Connector path is relative to the "editor/filemanager/browser/default" 
			folder. The user could even written his custom Connector and point the <STRONG>LinkBrowserURL</STRONG>
			to it, like "?Connector=/<STRONG>MyFolder/MyConnector.php</STRONG>
		" for example.
		<P>The same thing applies to the "ImageBrowserURL" configurations.</P>
		<H3>Configuring the Server Directory</H3>
		<P>
		All files handled by the editor point to a directory tree placed in the server 
		side. In this way, all uploads and urls point to that tree.
		<P>This tree has a single Root directory that is called, by default, "<STRONG>/UserFiles/</STRONG>
		". You should create this folder on you web site to avoid problems with the 
		File Browser.
		<P>In any case, it is possible to point the Root directory of your File Browser to 
			any directory you want. For example, suppose I wan't my files on a 
			"/Files/EditorFiles/" directory. I just need add an optional parameter to the 
			"LinkBrowserURL" configuration string. This paramenter is called "<STRONG>ServerPath</STRONG>
			". So, using our sample, the LinkBrowserURL string should be something like 
			this:</P>
		<code>FCKConfig.<STRONG>LinkBrowserURL</STRONG> = FCKConfig.BasePath + 
			"filemanager/browser/default/browser.html?Connector=connectors/aspx/connector.aspx<STRONG>&amp;ServerPath=/Files/EditorFiles/</STRONG>" 
			;</code>
		<P>The same thing applies to the "ImageBrowserURL" configurations.</P>
