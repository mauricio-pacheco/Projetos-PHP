CRM-CTT CHANGELOG
	(SEE THE UPGRADING FILE FOR UPGRADE ISSUES)

CRM-CTT [ http://www.crm-ctt.com - hidde AT crm DASH ctt DOT com ]	
(c) 2001-2006 Hidde Fennema

This is the change log for CRM-CTT. It is updated on-the-fly, so if you're 
reading this on-line from the project web site you might see features in here 
which are not yet released.

Don't forget to check the UPGRADING file

Mail me if you have a good idea to improve CRM-CTT.

23/05/2006 - Version 3.4.2
	
	New features

	- Text area's can now also contain rich text (see extra fields section)
	- New feature: NOBARSWINDOW. When enabled, opens CRM-CTT in a full-screen window without
	  menu- and address bars.
	- A new report method was added to the summary page: management information. When using this report
	  method, you'll end up in the management information section, where everything you'll see will be
	  filtered based upon the query you made on the summary page.
	- The upgrade script can now also be ran from the command line (see manual)
        
	Performance

	- Reduced the size of the main list output. Gain about 40% (on large pages) by using more CSS and javascript (thanks to 
	  ES Automatisering).
	- Deleted obsolete functions printeditform() & printeditform2(). Gain about 160KB in package size.

	Lay-out/cosmetics

	- Replaced the WYSIWYG editor 
	- Improved the trigger interface
	- The templates admin page is now tab-ized
	- Some tooltip hints in the extra fields page were added

	Extra fields

	- Custom created buttons which only trigger triggers. You can now add buttons, which save an entity and execute
	  some defined triggers. Cool option; you can combine the advanced access rights possibilities of an extra field with a 
	  form element (which is cool, trust me). Other triggers will also fire when appropriate, but the button trigger will fire 
	  last. If no value in a form is altered, only the triggers attached to the button will fire. This way you can create workflow
	  bypasses for specific users or groups.
	- New extra field type: rich text area. This will show a rich text editor so rich text can be stored in CRM-CTT. Copy-pasting from
	  applications like Word works perfect. Please do mind that the content will be saved as HTML, so when you offer this field for exports,
	  it will export HTML code.
	- New extra field type: checkbox (by popular demand)
	- Text area extra fields can now be sized
	- Text area extra fields can now have the clock-icon to insert date and time printed above them
	
	Misc

	- Next to the administration manual, there's now also a "configuration and management essentials" document
	  especially for non-technical users.
	- Bug not fixed: cache problem (customer field filter in main entity list) (couldn't reproduce this)
	- Replaced the 3.4.0 -> 3.4.1 upgrade routine. On very large tables (>1GB) it was killed by the kernel because it consumed
	  too much memory. The new routine is slower, though more memory-efficient.
	- The init page with the green moving gif will never be visible for more than 20 seconds even if cache buildup was
	  unsuccesfull.

        Custom HTML forms
	
	- Save as new entity-button for custom made forms (varuss@sf)
	- Add-text-only box for custom made forms

	Bug fixes

	- Bug fixed: Main entity list: Sortable by each field (links were not shown)
	- Bug fixed: Export Excel customers: list-of-crm-users displays as number, not names	
	- Bug fixed: SQL error when customer fields are used as filter in main list
	- Bug fixed: Vanished values in main list when showing customer field of User-List type
	- Bug fixed: management.php form-id saved wrong
	- Bug fixed: deleted users will no longer be exported
	- Bug fixed: LoV-extrafield in dropdown "more" list shows serialized array
	- Bug fixed: WebDAV check should be HTTPS-only compatible (Joaquim)
	- Bug fixed: inserted entities don't show extra field values (thanks to Gert) (3.4.1 patch on request)
	- Bug fixed: Language pack display on new installations shows 'PACK' as language pack
	- Bug fixed: Clicking "add a record" from customer page doesn't work with self made forms

	
26/02/2006 - Version 3.4.1

	Performance

	- Extensive intelligent caching routines added. To be switched on (default) or off by
	  altering global directive USE_EXTENDED_CACHE. This method may gain performace im-
	  provements up to 80%. When this function is enabled, you'll see a CRM-CTT logo and
	  an animated GIF image when you log on or switch repostories. When you see this, CRM
	  is building your cache arrays. It takes a little time but believe me, it's very use-
	  ful in most cases. To test if your database is faster with EXTENDED_CACHE enabled, run
	  "php -q update_cache.php -c MYSQLDATABASENAME" on the command line.
	- Binairy data is now stored in a tertiary table. Faster, but it makes the upgrade routine
	  a little heavy this time.
	
	Extra fields

	- Per-user and per-group access rights definition for extra fields (cool option!)
	- Box sizes can now be set for numeric and text fields (e.g. not for textareas)
	- New extra field type: "List Of Values". This is a field (type textbox) which can
	  hold multiple values.
	- New extra field type: "Drop-down based on customer list of values" (entity only). This
	  type will present a drop-down box, filled with values based upon an extra customer
	  field of type "List of values". (cool option!)

	Forms & templates

	- You can now also create your own (summary page) HTML-reports. Thanks to hakansoyler@sf
	  for bringing up the idea. (cool option!)
	- Under the main edit screen, a pulldown box is presented to switch the entity to 
	  another form type (admins only)
	- Customer edit screens now contain the RTF-report icon, and it is also available 
	  as template tag.
	- Attaching files from WebDav is now also possible with custom made forms

	Triggers
	
	- New trigger available: on event XX set form-id of the concerning entity to YY
	
	Security & user accounts

	- New clearance level: "full access though only see own assigned entities". This 
	  user is the same as the "full access though only edit own assigned entities" except
	  that this new user cannot see any other entities than the ones assigned to him/her.
	- Personal list layout settings are now stored in the database instead of in a cookie.
	- Custom navigation tabs can now be assigned to profiles (next to users)
	- Custom navigation tabs can now also show any of your HTML templates
	
	Administrative

	- New admin item (system configuration) : show trace link. Using a cookie you can now
	  enable the trace link (with log info) only for yourself (e.g. without bothering other
	  users with it)
	- Entity double-add-within-the-hour checking is now configurable (though still on by default)
	- Updated manual

	Management information

	- Added section "Form breakdown" to the "Quick summary" management information section

	Bug fixes

	- Bug fixed: when FormFinity is switched off, form-access-checking is disabled now to
	             avoid the nobody-can-see-any-entity-bug.
	- Bug fixed: the calendar sometimes showed entities which shouldn't be visible
	- Bug fixed: single-entity-invoicing icon works again
	- Bug fixed: adding entities from e-mail is now FormFinity-compatible (thanks to Edwin)
	- Bug fixed: EntityRelations select box now looks normal in custom made form
	- Bug fixed: Exchange HTML-emails now are stripped (HTML is stripped off)
	- Bug fixed: calendar shows no red duedate links in next months, only current
	- Bug fixed: Priority isn't saved when a limited user adds an entity in a 
	             custom made form
	- Bug fixed: The AutoComplete list sometimes contained categories of entities the
	             user is not allowed to see.
	

11/01/2006 - Version 3.4.0 (a lot of items, so this time we've put in some structure)
	
	Important changes for administrators

	- Clearance level change: when a user has CLLEVEL full-access-own-entities, he/she 
	  will from now on also be able to add entities unless specifically denied in user profile or 
	  group profile.
	
	Stunning (general new functionality)

	- FormFinity - Entities can now have their own HTML-forms. Users (and profiles) can
	  be authorized to use only a specific set of forms. When a user with rights to multiple
	  forms wants to add an entity, he/she gets to choose from the available forms. The resulting
	  entity will always show up in that form. Now it's really possible to use CRM-CTT for 
	  helpdesk tickets and coffee orders at the same time!
	- A new export-icon was added to the main entity list. Next to the usual MS Excel-icon there's a
	  new one showing 2 excel icons. This icon, when clicked, will export the list with the fields
	  you're viewing in your main list immediately without asking you which fields to export.
	- The main entity list filter boxes FINALLY work correct and fast! (whooho)
	
	Extra fields

	- Custom made forms can now have hidden (extra) fields containing pre-defined values.
	- New extra field type: numeric. This field can only have a numeric value; the user will
	  not be able to save an entity when it contains anything other than a number. Numeric 
	  fields are added up by default on the main entity list. This can be switched off by 
	  disabling global directive DISPLAYNUMSUMINMAINLIST.
	- New extra field type: User-list. This fields will be presented as a drop-down list con-
	  taining the users in CRM-CTT. This field can in turn be used for triggers (see below). It
	  can contain all admin users, all limited users, or all users.

	Forms & templates
	
	- HTML Forms can now have hidden extra fields containing values. With this you can make sure that
	  when a specific form is used, you can set some values without bothering the user with it.
	- Added HTML Form tag #PARENTBOX# to display entity parent-child information and select box
	- Customer forms can now also be templated (few words, lots of work :))

	Triggers

	- New trigger available: on event xx extend duedate with 1|2|3|4|5|10|20|30 days.
	- New trigger available: on event xx set assignee or owner to value selected in extra 
	  field yy (which must be of type 'user list').
	- New trigger available: on event xx e-mail the person selected in extra 
	  field yy (which must be of type 'user list').
	- New trigger available: fields which are not of type drop-down fields, can now also be
	  used for creating triggers, though only to_value [something else], not specific values.
	
	Security (related)

	- When an "Access denied" message is shown, a [trace] link is printed behind it. Clicking
	  it will show the qlog trace for the page the user is viewing.
	- Customer access check layer; just like entities, CRM-CTT now always checks a user's access 
	  to a customer. This makes CRM-CTT a little slower, but more secure and more consistent.
	- Authorisation models (CheckEntityAccess & CheckCustomerAccess) now also apply to management 
	  information section.
	- Improved security.
	- Better customer journaling.
	- From now on, Invoice Cost and Invoice Qty. fields will be checked to see if the user 
	  submitted numeric values. The user will not be able to save an entity when it contains 
	  anything other than a number. 

	Debug

	- Added getset.php debug-help ShowTraceLink. When set to 'true', a [trace] link is printed
	  at the end of each page, which when clicked shows the qlog trace for that page

	Misc

	- Base infrastructure for user-to-user messaging was build, but not yet made visible/active
	- Updated PHPMailer classes to latest version
	- Manual was updated, and more than 40 spelling bugs were "fixed" :)
	- Deleted flag bitmaps from jp/ directory. Package is now 1,5 MB smaller.
	- Updated build script. A nightly CRM-CTT development snapshot can now be downloaded from the
	  project download directory.
	- Next to normal builds, MAX builds are new. These builds are the same as the default
	  builds, except that all debugging information (qlog entries) is removed from the source code.
	  For very heavy installations (or very slow hardware) use this version. Please note that when
	  you encounter a problem, you'll need to have default (e.g. non-MAX) installation to get any 
	  debug information.
	- MySQL 5.x compatibility (experimental, but tested and found to work)
	- PHP 5.x compatibility (experimental, but tested and found to work)
	- Mail me if you've read this far so I know I don't put all this effort in the CHANGELOG for nothing :)

11/12/2005 - Version 3.3.2 rev1.

	- Custom made entity add and edit forms now also work OK for limited users
	- Little cosmetic change to the customer edit form (less icons)
	- A unified email FROM-address can now be set (in this version only in getset.php,
	  line 68, set $GLOBALS['UNIFIED_FROMADDRESS'] = "you@your.address.com", in future
	  releases this will be a global setting). This one is especially for Ryan.
	- ENABLEENTITYLOCKING is now set to 'Yes' by default

04/12/2005 - Version 3.3.2

	- Expirimental LDAP support
	- Entity parent/child support (expirimental). By enabling the global setting
	  ENABLEENTITYRELATIONS (and optionally HIDECHILDSFROMMAINLIST) you can relate
	  entities to each other.
	- Extra drop-down field lists can be be sorted (on request)
	- RSS Support. The administrator is now able to define an unlimited number of RSS
	  feeds based on SQL queries (examples are given). The result of the query, will 
	  always be matched against the user's rights - e.g. the authentication model is
	  still appliccable when viewing RSS fieds.
	- Users can now be limited (by user or profile) to working with only a given list
	  of customers. All other entities will be hidden.
		

20/08/2005 - Version 3.3.1 (important, major bug fix!)
	
	- Major 3.3.0 fixed. When using templated entity forms, all extra field values which 
	  you did *NOT* place in your form will be deleted when you save it. This also happens on
	  normal forms when the user is not entitled to see al fields - the field values the user 
	  cannot see will also be emptied on save.
	- Three triggers added: entity_add, entity_edit and entity_edit_checkbox

14/08/2005 - Version 3.3.0

	- Templated entity forms! The entity forms can now be designed to meet 
	  your demands. Using the known HTML-editor, you can model the forms 
	  using the same tags as you use for other templates. There are four 
	  types of entity forms which you can create yourself:
		1. The entity add form for full-access users
		2. The entity edit form for full-access users
		3. The entity add form for limited users 
		4. The entity edit form for limited users
	
	- HTTP Realm (BASIC) authentication is now supported. When a user is authenticated already
	  by the webserver, CRM-CTT will assume this is correct, and let the user in. This will
	  only work when a) the user indeed has an CRM-CTT account and b) the CRM-CTT configuration
	  directive AUTH_TYPE is set to "HTTP REALM". This feature should only be used in installations
	  which are not connected to the big bad internet.
	- User profiles now exist. Profiles can be created, and users can 
	  be coupled to such a profile. 
	- Configuration directive BODY_LIMITEDHEADER enables you to create a 
	  little HTML-header for the limited interface
	- Configuration directive BODY_URGENTMESSAGE enables you to display a 
	  message above each (full-user) page.
	- When using extra fields with default values, the records containing these values will now
	  be created immediately for each entity or customer. This is much better for statistics.
	- Added tooltips in the administration section. They can be disabled by disabling the
	  SHOW_ADMIN_TOOLTIPS directive in the main admin section.
	- Added a search box for the Global System Values section
	- MASSIVE performance improvement for repositories with much extra fields
	- Extra fields can now be emptied (thanks to Cheyenne) -> update, feature disabled!
	- The order in which triggers are processed is now OK - a trigger will always work
	  with the new values (also thanks to Cheyenne!)

02/07/2005 - Version 3.2.0 (2nd release)

	- Fixed a little "save and close" bug on the summary page
	- Fixed limited interface

26/06/2005 - Version 3.2.0 (E-mail integration and more)

	- Incoming (read-only) e-mail box over POP3 support (personal + system-wide)
	- Fixed a WebDAV bug - files with singlequotes no longer crash the 
	  database query
	- Added a misc trigger which when set can mail to users when the due date
	  (not the alarm date) is reached, request from forum (Pabloquintana, Fabrice)
	- Refurbished the install routine
	- Double entity add check now also on limited inserts of entities
	- Under water: all edit screens now use the same function - this makes 
	  all edit screens consistent and recognisable.
	- The administrator is now able to add customized navigation tabs linking to 
	  a specific page witin CRM or external webpages which will be displayed in 
	  a frame to the CRM-CTT navigation tabs will still be visible
	- Lots of bugs fixed in the invoice routine
	- When selected from the main list, the entity page now contains two arrows
	  which can be used to navigate trough the search results.
	- The layout of the add entity form for limited (insert-only) users can now
	  be adjusted. The admin can choose wether the limited user is able to set
	  the status, priority and duedate (by hiding or showing the field)
	- When a different report method is chosen when requesting a bookmarked
	  selection, this method overrules the bookmarked one; this enables the
	  user to request a PDF, RTF or CSV export whilst the bookmark was saved 
	  reporting method "brief" or "verbose".
	- The (old) "doesn't belong here" and "waiting for somebody else's action"
	  fields are now disabled by default. For compatibility reasons they can be
	  enabled using the USEWAITINGANDDOESNTBELONGHERE directive.
	- PDF Exports now have a reasonable name
	- Fixed a VAT calculation bug in the invoice routine, only occurring when 
	  values are entered including VAT (thanks to Philippe)

24/04/2005 Version 3.1.0 (small database adjustments, feature enhanchements)
	
	- Totally redesigned administration page. Let me know what you think.
	- Users can now also imported using plain-text CSV sheets
	- Extra fields can now be given a default value
	- Summary page searches can now be bookmarked
	- Authenticated SMTP servers are now supported
	- The mailer type is now configurable; can be either Sendmail (using the com-
	  mand line), mail (using the native PHP function) or smtp (using a network
	  connection to your or your provider's SMTP-server)
	- Refurbished the triggers page. It's more readable now.
	- Added 3 new event trigger options: stop-clock, start-clock, and reset-clock
	- Added extra field breakdown in the quick summary (management information)
	- Fixed an error which can cause a loop when having logtext set to "true".
	- Fixed cookie problem - username and password will now always be remembered
	  and the main list layout will be displayed correctly
	- Added support for exporting and importing the global settings table
	- Added support for exporting and importing extra field definitions
	- Read-only users will no longer lock an entity
	- Fixed: Colorpicker popup wont close
	- Fixed: invoicing with VAT-inclusive amounts (template issue: use LVAT i.s.o. VAT!)

10/04/2005 Version 3.0.0 (major update, templates will have to be re-written)

	Please mind: this version implements a complete new way of managing extra fields. This
	affects the user experience, and the upgrade routine is pretty heavy. It will take 
	care of all conversions to be done. The way it's implemented now makes CRM-CTT much 
	more flexible for future enhanchements. 

	Before upgrading, please check your unreferenced extra fields. After upgrading, fields
	which are already unreferenced in your current 2.6.2 installation cannot be restored. To
	avoid this, restore your unreferenced fields before upgrading, and delete them again
	afterwards.

	>| Because of the extra field change, you will have to edit all templates which use extra 
	>| fields values because the reference will be changed. Also, you'll need to re-set your
	>| main entity and customer list layout (if you had any extra fields in it)

	This version will display a (blocking) error message when you are running on 3.0.0 software
	using an 2.6.2 database (and vice-versa!). You (the administrator) will have to upgrade 
	before users can access the system.

	Test this release on a backup repository before upgrading your production system!

	- The extra field subsystem was completely revised. When upgrading,
	  take extra care. See the UPGRADING file for details.
	- Added support for required default and extra fields (!!!)
	- Adding and editing of extra fields is now done using a menu instead
	  of a syntax like "TB_name" or "DD_name|option1|option2". Next to
	  that, extra fields can now have any name you like - special
	  charactes like commas or quotes are now allowed.
	- Extra fields can now be placed on 4 places on the main edit entity page
	- Added a configuration option 'REQUIREDDEFAULTFIELDS' which enables you 
	  to set some standard fields to "required"
	- Added a configuration option 'FORCEDFIELDSTEXT': the message which is 
	  prompted when a user did not fill in all required fields
	- Added 2 extra field types: "comment" and "hyperlink". Using the first,
	  you can add comments in your list of extra fields to tell the
	  user something. The comments are based on HTML templates in your
	  database. 
	- Extra fields can now be hidden from non-full access users, like 
	  customers, - and, additionally, to all users but administrators.
	  When this is enabled, it will only show up with user having a "full 
	  access" or "administrator" clearance level.
	- An extra field type "invoice cost including VAT" was added. This enables
	  you to enter values which already include the VAT cost. The invoicing
	  routine will still break down the costs.
	- Default and extra customer fields can now also be shown in the main 
	  entity list. The extra fields can also be used as filters, but be 
	  aware; filtering on extra customer fields in your main enity list 
	  is sloooow and will generate quite heavy server load. You might want 
	  to restrict this. Customer fields in the main entity list will show 
	  up in blue.
	- Added configuration option ENABLEENTITYLOCKING which, when enabled, locks
	  an entity (for max. 10 minutes) when somebody opens an entity edit screen.
	  This is to prevent two people from editing the same entity at the same time.
	- Added the possibility to summarized fields in invoices. For instance, a
	  tag named @SUMEFID123@ will print the sum of extra field 123 of the 
	  entities used to generate the invoice.
	- Added "extra field inline edit modus". Works just as the language
	  tag display modus. All extra field names become links (only for the
	  current session) so you can edit the layout of your entity field
	  better.
	- Four styles (colors) can now be chosen: the default foreground color, 
	  the background color, the form element color, and the fieldset 
	  legend color. Embedded as configuration directives DFT_FOREGROUND_COLOR,
	  DFT_PLAIN_COLOR, DFT_FORM_COLOR, and DFT_LEGEND_COLOR.
	- The main font face and font color can now be alteren (DFT_FONT and
	  DFT_FONT_SIZE)
	- Added two more event triggers; "Limited user adds an entity" and
	  "Limited users updates an entity".
	- Improved the week calendar
	- Due dates in the past will now also show up in the main page calendar
	- HTML E-mail are better (better HTML layout)
	- Added "import entities" function to the administration section (!)
	- Added possibility to check if a customer already exists when adding 
	  a new customer (for Dick and Nicolaas)
	- All colors and fonts can be adjusted now (admin -> system config)
	- Added on-screen logging mode for administrators
	- Added a separated cache table and better cache housekeeping
	- Fixed garbled dates (in list, edit screen, PDF, CSV) when using a 
	  windows MySQL server
	- Added a Russian language pack to the project site

14/03/2005 Version 2.6.2

	- This version supports the use of different types of character 
	  encoding in your language pack. The default is still ISO-8859-1, 
	  but if you add a language tag to your language pack called 
	  "CHARACTER-ENCODING" (in capitals, without the quotes) 
	  containing the correct value, CRM-CTT will use this to override
	  the default encoding. (e-mail is not yet covered)
	- Event trigger options were vastly expanded; next to sending an
	  e-mail it's now also possible to (un)delete an entity, set it to
	  read-only or -write or update the status, priority, owner or 
	  assignee on any field value change event. Read: workflow!
	- The e-mail_in script, which can be used to insert entities
	  via e-mail, is no longer beta. It now also fully supports 
	  triggers and auto-assignments of entities to the owner
	  of the customer.
	- Triggered e-mails can now be configured to also attach a
	  report (an RTF report or the default PDF report)
	- Fixed a bug which caused extra fields to be parsed wrong
	  when using field numbers instead of names
	- Fixed a little age culculation bug
	- The customer id (CID) can now be used for searching a customer
	  and it can be used in templates (@CID@).

06/03/2005 Version 2.6.1 - SR1

	- In all read-only profiles the second entity text
	  box (allowing read-only users to add text) were added
	  back to the screen.
	- When parsing a single entity invoice, all entity fields in 
	  the whole template get parsed, instead of only the fields 
	  enclosed by the @REPEAT@ and @ENDREPEAT@ tags. The latter
	  is still the case when parsing invoices based on more than 
	  one entity.

27/02/2005 Version 2.6.1

	- ** Experimental support for PHP installations without having
	     PHP configuration directive REGISTER_GLOBALS set to 'On'. 
	     
	     CRM-CTT should now also work correctly without this dan-
	     gerous setting enabled, though testing is required. Any
	     volunteers out there?

	     Meanwhile, for production usage, it's still advised to
	     have the setting set to 'On'.

	- 2.6.1 fix1 updates: some profile bugs were fixed, and, more
	  important, in all read-only profiles the second entity text
	  box (allowing read-only users to add text) were removed.

	- The main entity list now supports filtering on status and
	  priority in a NOT-way; like all but having status "Open". This
	  can be switched on and off using the DISPLAYNOTOPTIONINFILTERS
	  directive in the Change Systems Values section
	- The main entity list now shows the number of found entities
	  in the fieldset title
	- Added support for numbered template tags instead of the full
	  extra field name
	- Incoming entities can now be assigned to the customer owner auto-
	  matically. This bypasses the "Incoming entity" list. To enable this,
	  set configuration directive AUTOASSIGNINCOMINGENTITIES to 'Yes'
	- RTF Reports are now streamed to the browser (instead of building 
	  the whole report in memory first). This decreases server-side
	  memory usage *a lot*
	- In the management information section, clicking on the customer
	  name now brings you to a more detailed screen containing specific
	  statistics for that customer
	- RTF Mailmerge functionality based on a selection was added to the 
	  customer page
	- The fixed fields in the customer list can now be used for sorting
	- Extra fields can now be placed (all at the time, not per field)
	  on either the top (just above the contents textarea) or at the
	  "normal" place, just above the file list. This can be cofigured
	  using the EXTRAFIELDLOCATION directive in the Change Systems
	  values section
	- Added trigger support to crmlogger and email_in
	- Triggered e-mails were attached by default; this can now be chosen
	- Sorting the entity list now also works in the limited interface
	- Fixed a little mail-merge bug causing customer e-mail merge
	  subjects not to be parsed

30/01/2005 Version 2.6.0 

	--- WARNING: This version includes new language tags. A new
		     English language pack is distributed with it,
		     and when upgrading, your English pack will be 
		     upgraded. All other languages now need an update.
		     The Dutch language pack is alread up-to-date, but
		     all other packs need to be completed. Please, please
		     send me your updated language pack, so I can place 
		     it on the project page for other users.

	- A new CRM-CTT logo is implemented in this version, thanks to 
	  the effort of Marcin and Lukasz. Please let me know what you 
	  think!
	- Custom-made entity (RTF) reports are now fully supported. (!)
	- Triggers on entity change actions are now supported. The admini-
	  strator is able to set a triggered event on almost all possible
	  entity changes. The e-mails which are sent as result of a 
	  triggered event are automatically attached to the concerning
	  entity and, if appliccable, the customer dossier
	- HTML Templates can now be uploaded and edited in the templates
	  section of the administration section. These HTML templates are
	  used for triggered events and for the mailmerge
	- E-mail merges can now be performed from the customers page.
	- E-mail merges can now be performed on any custom customer field (EML_*)
	- The summary search function was totally re-written. It is a 
	  little bit slower now, but much better. Selecting multiple 
	  extra fields in the search query now works.
	- An option "Generate entity report" was added as a display 
	  method on the summary page
	- The main entity list now has three icons in the top-right
	  corner: PDF, CSV (excel), and entity report export. These
	  exports are automatically based on the currently displayed
	  list of entities
	- A check was build in to make sure an entity is never added twice
	- The customer search funtion was replaced by the routine of
	  summary page. This means that multiple extra fields can be 
	  used for filtering, and that customer dossier attachments
	  also will be searched through. It's a little slower now. To 
	  avoid slow searching on simple queries, a second box was added
	  which only searches for customer names
	- All extra fields can now be used in all templates (RTF and HTML).
	  A link called "List of valid template tags" was added to the main 
	  admin page. It will show a list of all available tags based 
	  on hard-coded tags and the extra fields in your installation.
	- A setting called PDF-ExtraFieldsInTable was added; this lets 
	  you control the way extra fields show up in a PDF report. When
	  this setting is set to "Yes", extra fields will be printed in 
	  a table. Otherwise, each extra field will be printed on its own 
	  line (like in earlier versions).
	- When exporting entities (in PDF or CSV/Excel) more customer data
	  than just the name will be printed. In the PDF it's hardcoded
	  only the contact name, phone and e-mail, in the list exports
	  it will contain all fields (and extra fields).
	- Two more control options were added to the user profiles: 
	  Show customer tab and show deleted entities. These tabs can now also
	  be controlled per user (and still also global)
	- Customer exports based on a query doens't crash anymore when 
	  having selected many customers; the query is now handed over to the
	  export handler via the database instead of the old POST/tempfile
	  construction. This is faster and more safe.
	- The DIV showing customer info on the main edit entity page now 
	  contains another DIV which displays the attached files.
	- A configuration option called EnableSingleEntityInvoicing, which
	  enables a user to generate an invoice over a single entity. An
	  icon (MS Word-style) will be shown on the main edit entity page
	  when this feature is enabled. Everybody can use this function.
	- MAJOR performance improvements by adding more indexes
	- Some calendar performance updates were implemented
	- Fixed the "The image xxxxx.php cannot be displayed, because it contains
	  errors" bug when using CRM-CTT in Firefox.
	- Fixed a bug causing extra fields not being saved when saving an
	  entity for the first time.
	- Fixed a bug which made it impossible to edit extra customer fields
	- The manual was updated
	- Double-insert check on entities added


31/12/2004 Version 2.5.3

	- Customer dossiers can now also have file attachments
	- The PDF export routine for customers is now *much* better (=useful)
	- Added a configuration item called "ForceSecureHTTP" which enables the
	  admin to have CRM-CTT automatically redirect users to the HTTPS:// 
	  equivalent of the URL he/she is using when it's not HTTPS already. 
	  Naturally, your webserver must be configured to do this. On the logon
	  page, secure repositories are marked darker in the dropdown list.
	- A message can now be displayed on the main page (directive 
	  BODY_MainPageMessage in the "Change Systems Values" admin section)
	- Added 5 extra statistics (online and in the PDF report) :

			Top 20 entities (based on journal)
			Top 20 Users (based on journal (=actions))
			Top 20 Users (based on uselog (=every click)) 
			Top 20 slow open entities
			Top 20 slow deleted entities

	- Extra customer fields are can now also be ordered
	- All PDF tables of content are replaced by PDF-supported bookmarks (which
	  will display in the left pane in Acrobat)
	- A new extra field type was added: DATE_ Fields prefixed with DATE_ will show 
	  up as a date field (and pop the calendar when clicked)
	- The 'Edit Extra Fields' admin sections were improved
	- Invoicing now supports 2 types of invoices: one with a static VAT
	  percentage summed at the bottom, and one capable of generating 
	  invoices with multiple VAT percentages. The latter one requires 
	  new tags to be used in the template, after upgrading to 2.5.3 two new
	  example templates will be available in your installation.
	- When invoicing, the IHS_ (invoice hours spent) is no longer required. If
	  the extra field is not there, or if it just isn't entered, the invoice
	  routine will default this value to 1. Wether or not it appears on the
	  result invoice, is up to the template.
	- Invoice numbers now work. It's a 6-digit number (when needed prefixed 
	  with 0's) which auto-increments. A prefix for this number can be set 
	  using the administration section. (change systems values)
	- When invoicing, the customer journal is now kept up-to-date, and the
	  concerning (individual) invoice can also be attached to the customer 
	  when requested, even when generating a complete multi-customer invoice.
	- When mailmerging, it's an option to attach the individual documents to
	  the customer dossier (for archive purposes)
	- EID's of deleted entities now appear in red in the main and brief lists
	- Added the age/duration field as an option to the lists (sortable)
	- The main page now also displays recent entities in color in Firefox
	- Journals are now sorted by log id instead of the timestamp (which is better)
	- Fixed a bug causing extra fields longer than 20 chars to generate an
	  error when saving a second entity
	- Fixed a bug causing entities to be saved w/o a customer when the customer
	  list was used to create the entity from
	- Fixed a bug in the managemen information (waiting entities and 'entities
	  that don't belong here are now displayed correct)
	- Fixed a bug which deleted a little too much journal entries
	- Fixed a little bug in the customer search function
	- Fixed a bug which kept the duedate alarm subject the same within one cycle
	- Fixed a little bug in crmlogger.php - the "waiting" value was not set to
	  'n' when adding a new entity

05/12/2004 Version 2.5.2

	- Invoice and mailmerge support based on RTF templates added. CRM-CTT is 
	  able to create invoices and mailmerges based on RTF-format templates.
	  See the manual for more details.
	- Added a plug-in which can be used to insert entities into CRM-CTT
	  from e-mail. An example for a Sendmail MTA is included in the manual.
	  The script is called email_in.php; it's able to process attachments,
	  and will send a nice (configurable) reply to the sender. E-mails inserted
	  into CRM-CTT will appear on the "inserted entities" list. For now, this
	  plug-in has beta status.
	- Added a "database cleanup" function which enables admins to 
	  physically delete a set of entities (by logical delete date) to
	  reduce used disk space and increase performance
	- Added a setting called "MAINPAGELINKS". You can now display some
	  links on the main page.
	- Extra fields can now be ordered
	- The "inserted entities" list now has a delete button which enables 
	  administrators only to physically delete the inserted entity (without
	  any form of confirmation that is!)
	- E-mail subjects can now be adjusted in the main administration section:

		- SUBJECT_NEW_ENTITY
		- SUBJECT_CUSTOMER_COUPLE
		- SUBJECT_UPDATE_ENTITY 
		- SUBJECT_ALARM
		- SUBJECT_EMAILINSERT_REPLY

	  The usual tags can also be used in these subjects, except for @CONTENTS@.

	- Changed the date/time/user insert function from 2 lines to 1
	- Added support for setting alarm dates using crmlogger

	- crmlogger was not logging the "closeepoch" when setting an 
	  entity to "deleted" - this garbles statistics
	- Fixed a duration/age bug when exporting excel sheets
	- Fixed some week detail calendar bugs (private entities won't show up anymore)
	- Fixed a bug in the management information PDF wich caused the "entities
	  closed this week" (and month) to always be 0. 
	- Fixed a bug in the function which creates WebDAV links. WebDAV now also works
	  over a secure (HTTPS) connection.
	- Fixed a bug in the PDF management information. The "entities opened this week" 
	  and "entities opened this month" values were always shown as 0
	  
	

07/11/2004 Version 2.5.1
		
	- Added a console logger (crmlogger.php) which enables you to add
	  and edit entities from your Windows or Linux (UNIX) command prompt.
	  This method can thus be used for (e.g.) logging your backup script
	  results or, with a little configuration of you mail server, make it
	  possible to e-mail directly into CRM. All this is covered in the 
	  manual, so please read that first.
	- Added week calendar and entity duetime scheduling.
	  By clicking the week number in the calender,
	  the user will get a week overview of that week. This works in all
	  calendar appearances but the alarm date calendar; alarms still
	  can occur only once a day (not ok? let me know plz)
	- Navigation tabs "Add", "Entities", "CSV", "PB" and "Summary" can
	  now be blocked on a system level, but also blocked or unblocked
	  per user user profile. You now have total control. :)
	- The creation date can now also be shown in the main entity list
	- It's now possible to on-line copy a customer database from another
	  repository to the one you're working in. This is quite handy when
	  you want to share customers between mulitple repositories. One repository
	  must be master, while the other will be slave.
	- Added an extra field type for e-mail addresses: use "EML_" as prefix. When
	  clicked, a CRM-CTT screen for emailing will occur (e.g not the default system
	  mail client)
	- Fixed a bug in the management information wich caused the "entities
	  closed this week" (and month) to always be 0. 
	- The customer can now also be e-mailed from the main edit enitity page
	- The e-mail link in the phonebook now points to a CRM-CTT e-mail screen
	  instead of the "mailto:" link
	- Fixed a bug causing the tabs to highlight incorrect when having 
	  HIDECUSTOMERTAB set to on (and using CRM as a non-admin user).
	- The creation date in the main entity list is now displayed in 24-hour format
	- Fixed a (non-critical) bug in the "Import language pack" function

17/10/2004 Version 2.5.0
	
	- Revised the "Check database" function. It now also has a command line
	  interface (to run it daily or weekly using cron) and it checks more tables
	  for consistancy
	- Updated the manual. An appendix explaining to use of command-line scripts
	  has been added
	- Added the option to let every update of a specific entity be mailed to the
	  owner or the assignee of that entity
	- Added configuration setting for the temporary filespace location
	- Added an option to let the duedate notify script also check for due dates
	  (and thus email alarms) on already deleted entities (directive ALSO_PROCESS_DELETED)
	- Added a 'private' checkbox to each entity. When set to private, nobody 
	  else will see this entity; only the owner and the assignee will see it
	- Added an option to only view today's log messages
	
19/09/2004 Version 2.4.6

	- Added a print-icon on the main edit entity page, which when clicked
	  opens a window which immediately prints the PDF summary.
	- Added functionality for importing and exporting user-accounts, which
	  is handy when cloning repositories.
	- When FORCECATEGORYPULLDOWN is set to Yes, the summary page displays a
	  filter box for the category (request #369)
	- Added duration and age reporting to all exports and summary pages (age 
	  when the entity is not deleted, duration when it is deleted) Please mind;
	  this information will only be available when an entity was added in CRM 
	  version 2.4.6 or higher.
	- Added support for pre-defined entity comments. This way the admini-
	  strator can define some lines of text (like "I'm on it" or "Done") which
	  can be easily inserted into the body of an entity by the users. This is 
	  obviously for lines of text which are often the same. The option to 
	  configure this can be found in the Change Global System values section
	  under directive "STANDARD_TEXT".
	- The summary page now also remembers the extra fields searched in the 
	  previous search and displays this again when the form returns. Also,
	  the "More" tab will remain open.
	- Adjusted the PDF report - the extra fields no longer display in a table;
	  they're just printed (wordwrapped). This fixes the wrapping problem when 
	  having large values in your extra fields. Thanks to Steve Mueller.
	- Made the customer page main list treshold configurable. Before, CRM-CTT 
	  didn't display the list if it was longer than 150 customers, for bandwith
	  reasons. This number is (out of the box ) still 150, yet it can be con-
	  figured in the Change Global Systems values section under directive 
	  "CUSTOMER_LIST_TRESHOLD".
	- Updated the layout of the account management page
	- Fixed a WebDAV bug
	- The manual was updated
	- Little layout bug fixed in cust-insert.php and management.php

05/09/2004 Version 2.4.5 

	- Fixed a little bug in management.php
	- JavaScript error in cust_insert.php fixed
	- More trigger options added - an owner or an assigne is now able to 
	  select to receive e-mail updates every time the entity is edited
	- A higher-than-i-liked number of little (buried deep-down) bugs fixed in:
		- The management interface
		- The limited interface
		- The check-db routine
		- The edit status and priority variable routines
		- The installer 
	- Some e-mail functions were optimized
	- Added an administrative option to block all Excel and PDF export functions
	  for non-adminisrative users

30/08/2004 Version 2.4.4 (feature addons, no database changes)
	
	- Added more navigation shortkeys. Press ALT-H to see them.
	- Added a little icon to the tab header bar for switching between
	  repositories.
	- Fixed a little bug in the original ShowRepositorySwitch routine
	- Improved the "Change systems values" section
	- Replaced the HTML editor
	- Some escape bugs fixed

22/08/2004 Version 2.4.3 (feature addons)

	- Users can now switch dynamically between repositories, if their account 
	  information (username/password) is consistant. As always, the administrator
	  can disable this feature, or set it to only show when the user is an admin.
	  The repository switcher appears on the main page and on the admin page.
	- The due_notify now can also send an e-mail containing all the receipients
	  non-deleted entities (both HTML and text)
	- Users can now edit their own profile (full name, password, daily entity
	  mail subscription). This can be disabled in the administration section 
	  (directive LetUserEditOwnProfile)
	- The administrator can send an entity list mail to all users manually (admin section)
	- Improved the routine which pops up the calendar (it now only comes once)
	- Improved the routine which auto-inserts the date and time
	- Major code cleanup
	- 2.4.2 error with temporary files location fixed
	- New build procedure (lots of work, but you won't mention :))

12/08/2004 Version 2.4.2 (2.4.1 bugfixes, minor feature addons)
	
	- Added the configuration directive AutoInsertDateTime (default = Yes (!)) - with this
	  option you can enable auto-insertion of date and time when a user adds text to 
	  an entity
	- Fixed the "id=" bug.
	- Fixed the "non-writeable content field with read-only-assigned entities" bug
	- Fixed the double escape bug in the customers table. Comment fields in
	  this table containing an ' are now processed ok
	- On the summary and customer pages, extra fields can now also be selected as filters (!)
	- A database maintenance option was added in the admin section. This 
	  function optimizes all tables (mysql: OPTIMIZE TABLE), repairs them,
	  and it checks all references of customers, extra fields, and files.
	- PDWAS links on main page were removed

20/06/2004 Version 2.4.1 (2.4 bugfixes, performance)
    
	- Added a lot of caching routines to decrease the number of database
	  queries needed to process a page. For instance, the main page uses
	  around 20 queries less then before only due to caching. Large PDF
	  reports are significantly faster.
	- The category field can now also be auto-completed based on category
	  fields already in the database. It's not forced to select a value which
	  already exists; the user may still enter any value. As this is only
	  handy and never blocking, this option is set to "Yes" by default.
	- Added a "Save as new entity" button to the main edit entity page,
	  which is only displayed when the "ShowSaveAsNewEntityButton" directive
	  is set in the administration setting. Default is "Yes".	
	- The customer database and page is much better. When searching, extra
	  fiels are also searched through. The list lay-out can now be configured
	  in the administration section in the same way the entity list can be
	  configured. The result of a search can now be exported.
	- Image file inclusions are now done using temporary file storage instead
	  of fetching the image using HTTP.
	- Added enhanched error checking and (when chosen) automatic submission
	  of SQL errors directly into the Development repository at 
	  http://crmstage.it-combine.com or via e-mail.
	- Links in the TOC of PDF reports now work again
	- The main list can now also be sorted by duedate
	- Command-line tool added to generate a PDF report for all entities. This
	  command can also be used for batch generating reports (e.g. using cron). 
	  Syntax: php -q ./generate_total_pdf_summary.php - use --help for usage
	  instructions.
	- Rebuilt the "view log" function. You can now query the log for any text,
	  or filter all warnings and errors.

23/05/2004 Version 2.4.0 (WebDAV, International dates, improved flow, +features)
		
	- Added an option to disable the customers page for non-administrative
	  users (directive HideCustomerTab). If set, the tab "customers" will 
	  disappear (for non-administrators) and the page will be inaccessable 
	  (also when deeplinked). Also, when set, the phonebook will not display 
	  information from the customers table. The only way for a normal user 
	  to see the customer information, is to click on the dropdown arrow 
	  on the main entity screen. He/she will never be able to get a list 
	  of all your customers for export purposes.
	- The filter and sort variables in the main entity list are stored when 
	  using them, and if the next time the list is shown no filter and/or
	  sort options are supplied, CRM retrieves the old filter and sort 
	  variables and shows the list exactly the way the user last viewed it.
	  CRM remembers the difference in sorts and filters between the main
	  and the deleted entities lists.
	- If an entity was accessed via the main list, after saving it CRM will
	  bring the user back to the list. Same goes for the summary list.
	- Date format support. You can now choose between MM-DD-YYYY (USA) and 
	  DD-MM-YYYY (rest o/t world). Set DateFormat in Systems Values section.
	- All priority and status pulldown boxes are now colored
	- All e-mails (entity and customer) are now logged in the appropriate 
	  journals (sometimes only in the entity journal, sometimes in the 
	  customer journal, sometimes in both)
	- The main page recent and "today" list have status and priority in color
	- The PDF export are much, much better (including extra fields and colored
	  status and priority variables)
	- When e-mailing, the EntityContents.txt file was replaced by the PDF report
	  of the concerning entity
	- In the main edit entity window, ALT-S saves the entity
	- Status and priority colors now also appear in the HTML e-mails
	- Added an admin function which exports the complete working repository
	  to disk in a directory/file structure
	- WebDAV Support. WebDAV a.k.a Webfolders is a method to access
	  files over the HTTP protocol. The expirimental PDWAS system works
	  great, though WebDAV works using a standard protocol. The advantage
	  of PDWAS is that it works with all types of applications, where WebDAV
	  only works with applications which support the WebDAV protocol. Most 
	  office applications support WebDAV however, like MS Office, OpenOffice,
	  and KDE even has an protocal handler for it (webdav://). The best part
	  of CRM WebDAV support lies in the fact that, as all things in CRM, it's
	  completely built in PHP using the HTTP_WebDAV_Server classes made by
	  Hartmut Holzgraefe <hholzgra@php.net>. Hartmut; Thanks!
	  The CRM Adminmanual is updated. Please read the WebDAV section on more
	  information on how WebDAV is used in CRM. Please be aware that you
	  need at least PHP 4.3.0 in order to use WebDAV. 
	  ** Please mind ** CRM-CTT ships with WebDAV subsystem disabled.
	- Changed the "Journal", "PDF Report" and (for the 2.4 pre1 users) WebDAV
	  text links on the main edit entity pages to icons.
	- Added activity graphs to entity PDF reports
	- Added a little icon on the main entity screen which when clicked spawns
	  a little window showing the activity graph of the concerning entity.
	- Automatic session management (expired sessions are cleaned up better)
	- Enhanched security (I'm not going to tell what; it's not critical)
	- The field length of custom field *names* was expanded from 240 chars
	  to LONGTEXT.
	- Fixed alarm date screen - USA date now also works

	Fixes:

	- 358 fixed - Critical	- Extra fields not saved on first save
	- 351 fixed - High	- after editing from main list, return to list
	- 352 fixed - High	- Remember last sort
	- 326 fixed - High	- Being able to hide custom fields in customer screen
	- 362 fixed - High	- ALT-S to save an entity
	- 278 fixed - Medium	- Date format
	- 300 fixed - Medium	- Add customer owner
	- 314 fixed - Medium	- Link on customers page to list of entities of that customer
	- 317 fixed - Medium	- List of links to Language packs to automatically install
	- 350 fixed - Medium	- custom fields too narrow
	- 320 fixed - Medium	- Make e-mail to customer an internal link
	- 355 fixed - Medium	- Add PNG stat images to PDF report (mansum and normal)

28/03/2004 Version 2.3.0

	- Customer journaling added partially. The journal logs adding a customer
	  and joining an entity to a customer
	- Customer owner added, with an option to e-mail the owner when an entity
	  is joined to that customer
	- It's now possible to add a user with the same name as a previously deleted
	  user, as long as the previous user was deleted with CRM 2.3.0 or higher. 
	  When you're in need of a script or intructions on how to physically delete
	  users deleted with CRM <2.3.0, please send me an e-mail.
	- CRM_PDWAS Added (EXPIRIMENTAL). PDWAS means Pretty Dirty Web Authoring
	  System. It's a Windows installer which enables you to open a file 
	  (e.g. Excel, Word) directly from CRM, and when you close your application
	  the file will be automatically uploaded to CRM and joined to the entity 
	  which it came from as a new file. READ THE MANUAL BEFORE USING PDWAS. There
	  is a specific manual for PDWAS included in the distribution. PDWAS is
	  DISABLED by default. Enable the ShowPDWASLink directive to enable it.
	- The main entity list can now also be sorted by EID
	- 327 High BUG: Help windows dont show up [fixed]


07/03/2004 Version 2.2.0

	- Added an option to install language packs directly from the CRM project 
	  page - please note that your server needs to be able to reach the web 
	  if you want to use this function.
	- Added mail to {everybody} functionality. One can now mail the owner, the
	  assignee, the customer, and (if selected) any other user of your CRM 
	  installation.
	- When deleting an entity, the 'closedate' field is now always set
	- Adjust sort order of fieldsets in main edit entity screen; custom fields
	  are now displayed above files
	- Added a link from the [customers] page to the list of entities coupled to
	  that customer


01/03/2004 Version 2.1.0 (focus: +clearance level, +features, +security, +performance)

	- The administrator is now able to choose the global colums configuration
	  to show in the several entity lists, including extra fields(!). When
	  enabled (LetUserSelectOwnListLayout), the user can override this 
	  with his/her personal preference (stored in a cookie). In the management 
	  and cust-insert modus the user cannot override, ofcourse.
	- Performance improvement. An entity main page list containing 27
	  entities now executes 70 MySQL instead of over 140, and when
	  switching on showing the number of attachments, the page is
	  about 324% faster! (indexing helps!). Searching trough binairy
	  documents (Word, Excel etc) is also dramatically faster.
	- A link on the main page "User Name's dashboard" which links to 
	  a page with a clear overview of own entities, assigned entities,
	  calendar, and recent entities.
	- New clearance level; based on te customer-insert-user, but then
	  with an option to let this user see the contents of the entities 
	  add by him/her and add comments to those entities like in the 
	  restricted interface (management.php). 
	  
	  So, we had clearance level:

		Insert-only customer-user
	  
	  Which now is:
		
		Insert-only customer-user unable to read contents of added entities
	     +  Insert-only customer-user able to read contents of added entities

	  Please note: the second user can see both unassigned AND assigned entities he/she
	  has inserted (or are entered otherwise) as long as those entities are attached 
	  to the [customer] to which the insert-only user is coupled!

	- Security improvements regarding PDF exports. Mail me if you want
	  any details on this.
	- Rewrite of upgrade procedure - from 2.1.0 and higher it's much more
	  database-safe and more user-friendly.
	- Improved the import_files.php script - had a bug and was
	  slow. A test proved that loading over 20,000 files into CRM
	  is no problem: "Total 36962042 bytes (approx.35 MB) in 20,596 files."
	  The syntax for this script still is $ php ./import_files.php or 
	  c:\php\php.exe import_files.php (from the command line that is!)

22/02/2004 Version 2.0.0 (please read - security related issues)

	Proudly announcing version 2.0 of CRM

	Since even the Linux Journal wrote an article about CRM, it becomes
	even more challenging to keep everybody happy with it. Over the last
	two years I've received many thousands reactions, feature requests,
	and bug reports. Some questions considered functionality buried so 
	deep down in the "basement" that I too had to check what it was and
	how it worked again. Very nice to see that people are really using
	the product to the maximum of its extend. One reaction I remember 
	very good was about the customer overview page: "I've imported around
	5000 customers into CRM and the customers page becomes a little hard
	to work with. Can you improve this?". When I designed CRM, and we first
	started to use it, we had around 25 customers registered in it. :)

	With version 2.0 a new lay-out is introduced. This lay-out has been 
	chosen to make it more intuitive to work with, and more recognisable.

	I'd very much would like to know what you think about the new style, 
	so please, please send me feedback - I cannot improve CRM without 
	feedback. So, please send your opinion to hidde AT it-combine.com.

	Also regarding the lay-out: be sure to test version 2.0 first. Apart
	from the database version number nothing has been changed in the 
	data-model so you can safely use the new code against your old
	database (but don't forget to run upgrade.php later on if you 
	start really using 2.0)

	In 2.0 lots of feature requests are implemented, though not all. Refer
	to http://crmstage.it-combine.com (user CRM, pass crm, repos. Main Devel.)
	for a list of things to come in 2.1.

	- SECURITY RELATED: An administrative option was added to execute 
	  custom-made queries. This option comes in 2 forms; a wizard-like 
	  interface which leads you through several steps and creates a query, 
	  and an option to execute a query directy (e.g. you can type the
	  query and execute it). The latter is potentionally dangereous. It
	  only excludes DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE; all other queries are
	  allowed. To disable the latter function, edit admin.php and 
	  uncomment '// $Disable_direct = "1";' to '$Disable_direct = "1";'
	  at the top of the file. Note: you can ONLY disable direct queries,
	  not the wizard queries.
	- Added a new Clearance Level: "Full access though only edit own assigned entities"
	  this user is able to read *everything*, though can only edit his/her own
	  assigned entities (but cannot change the owner, assignee, or [deleted] status).
	  He or she can view customers, though not edit or add them. He/she is also
	  unable to add entities. This clearance level should actually be the main
	  operating level for non-managing assignees.
	- Added command-line interface for uploading files into CRM. You 
	  need to have an administrative account to use it. With this tool
	  you can attach the contents of a local (server that is) directory
	  to a specific entity ID. Syntax: php import_files.php.
	- Shortcut keys to the tabs (ALT-1 .. ALT-0) added with an option to show 
	  these numbers on the tabs (ShowShortKeyLegend).
	- Added config option ShowFilterInMainList - when setting this to yes drop-down
	  boxes will appear at the top of the main entity overview list so the list can 
	  be filtered. Very handy.
	- Added config option DontShowPopupWindow - when setting this to yes the
	  pop-up menu in the main entity list will not appear anymore but instead,
	  when clicking on the row, you will be brought to the main edit entity
	  screen immediately
	- You can now click Prev and Next in the calendar
	- Added an icon to insert time/date/username into textbox on main edit
	  entity form, as well as two icons to de- or increase the text box size.
	- When exporting customers, the extra fields are now also exported
	- Native Microsoft Excel exports now possible (with nice colors) - you need
	  the PEAR libs to use this function -> http://pear.php.net/
	- Fixed little bug in 'create new repository' function
	- Fixed little journal bug (wrong e-mail address displayed)
	- 259 Critical BUG: error when only searching for a specific assignee
	- 294 Critical BUG: Read-only-all profile broken
	- 262 Critical BUG: Mainpage cal days <10 in month dont show
	- 256 Critical BUG: Accounts Edition
	- 259 Critical BUG: ERR where Summary of entities is requested where Owner = "all" and Assignee <> "all"

23/01/2004 Version 1.9.6 (mainly bug fixes - important bug (#256) fixed)

	- Customers can now be disabled - disabling a customer means that 
	  when disabled, a customer can no longer be selected in ONLY the
	  add and edit forms of CRM. When searching, the disabled customer
	  WILL appear, as it will also appear for insert-only users (e.g. 
	  disabling just a customer won't disable an insert-only account)
	- Deeplinking to entities or summary pages now is possible. A non-
	  logged in user will be presented with a login page, though the
	  original URL deeplink will be preserved
	- The installer now checks for register_globals
	- The insert-only interface got a makeover
	- File downloads (views) are now also mentioned in the journal
	- Bug #248 Fixed: Also search filenames of which contents is ignored
	- Bug #251 Fixed: Extra fields dont show up on incoming entities
	- Bug #256 Fixed: Error in account edit function
	- Bug in installer fixed thanks to Jamie (j-me) - the configuration
	  directive BODY_ENTITY_EDIT was not created using the last versions
	  of install.php. This is fixed, and the upgrade procedure of 1.9.6
	  checks if the field exists, and if not, creates it.

11/01/2004 Version 1.9.5 (important changes included, please read!)
	
	- Important- please note! insert-only users can now also see
	  the list of entities they (or others using the same account)
	  have added earlier. Please check if this matches your wishes.
	- Added more journal entry points
	- Adjusted calendar - dates in the past can now also be selected
	- View Journals option added to administration page
	- Added support for custom text-boxes using TB_ syntax similar
	  to the TB_ customer fields syntax	
	- Entity contents journaling support; Option added to show a 
	  drop-down box wich contains the timestamps of all changes to 
	  an entity; the user can roll back as far as desired. This option 
	  is always enabled, though only displayed if system directive 
	  EnableEntityContentsJournaling is set to "Yes" - which it is 
	  by default. Thanks to Kaveh Goudarzi <kaveh AT arkasoft DOT KOM> 
	  for the patch!
	- Numerous layout improvements
	- The "Active" option for accounts is gone - now, when deleting an
	  account, the account is actually set to inactive. Accounts cannot
	  be physically deleted anymore but an inactive account will not show
	  up in the login accounts management section. The account could be 
	  re-activated directly in the database, by setting "active" from "no"
	  to "yes". CRM is not going to provide this option.
	- Notification when en entity is changed - as soon as a value in the 
	  main edit entity page is changed, the user is notified. Also, when
	  leaving the page without saving, the user will be promted and asked
	  if the changes should be saved.
	- Customer e-mail address on main edit entity page now is a mailto: link
	- Customer address and remarks on main edit entity page now also show
	  line breaks
	- If customer home page exists, but isn't prefixed with http://, CRM
	  adds this to make the link work
	- Security improved (please mail if you need details on this)
	- Bug #216 Fixed (SetCustomer when having autocomplete on)
	- Bug #230 Fixed (Contact e-mail doesn"t display in entity edit pulldown arrow window)
	- Bug #235 Fixed (Owner & Assignee always same in update email)
	- Bug #226 Fixed (Show category value in main edit entity window)
	- Bug #227 Canceled - we couldn't reproduce this problem
	  (Number instead of name in e-mail)

	- Entity journaling support. The complete history of changes
	  (when, who, and what) now can be viewed.
	- Added an option AutoCompleteCustomerNames which enables

	  customer page (request #207)

	  makes multiple repositories within 1 MySQL
	  database possible.

	  and status)

05/10/2003 Version 1.9.0 (major changes)

	Please note: the CRM global usage structure has been 
	changed for this version. The standard status 
	variable "close" is not interpreted anymore since
	status variables are now configurable. The upgrade
	procedure handles this, however it requires a 
	little "getting used to" if you are used to using
	former versions of CRM.
	
	- Added the option to send the assignee an e-mail
	  when an entity is added and assigned to him/her
	  or when one of his/hers entities is updated
	- Total customer administration and navigation
	  revesion
	- Fixed a language bug in the calendar

	- Communicated queries (from summary to csv page) now
	  are coded and unreadable
	- Added a pop-up window when searching for random text
	  strings. The window closes automatically when the 
	  search is ready.
	- Added the possibility to mark an entity as "read-only"
	  for users who are neither owner nor assignee. When this
	  box is checked, attached documents are also protected to
	  being read by a read-only user.
	- When searching, binairy attachments now will also be
	  searched. e.g. all text in a Word document will be 
	  matched case-IN-sensitive, though binairy (executable)
	  files and images will be skipped. Works really well.
	- Fixed a bug when physically deleting an entity
	- The phonebook now searches also in the [customer]
	  contact data
	- PDF reports and exports now are lined out, though the font
	  type now is Courier, which in turn is not really pretty
	- Increased the width of the overlib popup windows
	- 2 languages added for download (Brasilian- Portuguese 
	  and French)
	- Little link bug fixed (lan_entries to lan_entries.php)
	  (this did work on the test systems)
	- Some spell corrections in the English pack file
	- Standard supplied language packs now only display
	  the language name in the native language instead
	  of showing it in Englisch (i.e. Frech became Francais)
	- Updated a deprecated directive in install.php which might
	  have caused warnings when installing on a very new PHP
	  installation (mysql_create_db() -> "SQL CREATE DATABASE")
	- Added a user type which can view all entities, not only
	  his/her own. New user type is called "Read-only all entities"
	- When an entity is added, the standard owner now is the
	  the user which adds the entity.
	- Improved session deletion when logging out
	- Bug #85 fixed
	- Added a check_config function to check for double configuration
	  entries.


30/06/2003 Version 1.8.1

	- Complete mail subsystem revision (containing:)
	- Email bodies are now editable
	- When an add-entity alarm email is sent, the
	  entity contents and attached documents are
	  now mailed also as attachments.
	- Fixed a bug in duedate-notify-cron.php
	- The SMTP server to use now is configurable
	- Extra error handling added for cookie errors
	- Inserted entities can now also be deleted 
	  without being assigned/owned first
	- Now used array $_FILE for uploads instead
	  of $userfile (this fixes the windows 
	  upload bug)
	- Admin's can now only alter repositories in
	  which they have an admin account


20/06/2003 Version 1.8 stable (major issues included)
	
	- All 7 items from 1.8-pre1 (including 2 majors)
	- Major: Customer insert subsystem added. This adds the
	  possibility for [customers] to add entities by them-
	  selves. (by coupling a certain user to a customer)
	- Security issue entity #46 fixed (see devel CRM for details)
	- Two more appearences of "Edit Extra Fields" removed
	- Clearance level method adjusted (the 'limited' and 'administrator
	  bullets when managing users are gone)
	- Some of the tables in the main view can now be sorted. It 
	  concers "status","priority","category" and "customer".
	- Lots and lots and lots of logging points added.
	- Flatlogging disabled (only actions are logged, not all hits)
	- Option to empty the session table added in the repository
	  management section
	- Option to download the log in CSV added in the View logs
	  & stats section
	- Administration page modified (it now looks better and
	  is more consistant)
	- Some security enhanchments (no alarming issues)
	- Statistics page dramatically reduced. Only activity sta-
	  tistics are shown, all other graphs were removed.
	- The edit page for restricted users (read-only own entities) now 
	  is also multilingual
	- Manual updated
	- Little fixes to install and upgrade procedures

04/06/2003 Version 1.8-pre1 (major issues included)

	- Major: "login users" and "owners/assignees" are now merged.
	- Major: Complete Extra Field Management interface added, extra 
	  fields are now consistant and 100% safe to work with (they 
	  were safe to work with already but now it's also understandable)
	- Option added to empty the phonebook before importing new data
	- The first installed user (during installation procedure) is 
	  now directly an administrator. Users with only the right 
	  admin password cannot grand administrative rights to
	  themselves or other users anymore.
	- Custom fields are now displayed in the regular edit window
	  which also means that the "Edit extra values" option is 
	  removed on various locations
	- Added option to edit an entity in the main window when using
	  the popup window in the main entity list
	- PDF manual added (draft state)
	- Installer procedure adjusted (better checks)

06/05/2003 Version 1.7d

	- PDF exports of your phonebook now works again
	- Added a configuration option to adjust the number of months which are chown 
	  in the various calendar appearences.
	- Cookie timeout problem handled
	- Added "owner" tag when listing files
	- Owners/assignees can now be deleted given they have no entities connected to them

04/02/2003 Version 1.7c
	
	- Added epoch values in links to prevent page caching when using a Microsoft proxy (e.g. ISA)
	  (mentioning ISA because is keeps caching no matter what is in your (pragma) source)
	- Fixed a bug which prevented a newly added entity to show up on the summary page (sorting problem)
	- "Tag display mode" added in the language management module. When switched on, all language
	  identifitaction tags are displayed with the values. Very handy when translating CRM.

21/01/2003 Version 1.7b

	- Little CSV download bug fixed

14/01/2003 Version 1.7a (clean installs only, do not upgrade!)

	- Windows login bug fixed

29/12/2002 Version 1.7 stable (clean installs only, do not upgrade!)
	
	- Language pack management
	- Multi repository support (add/remove entire databases)
	- E-mail notification when adding a new entity (still limited, though)
	- Possibility to install CRM without creating a main database first
	- Multilingual support
	- Translation module 
	- Extended PDF support
	- Support for custom entity fields (!)
	- Enhanched translation module
	- Enhanched navigation
	- Enhanched administration module
	- Some iconisation
	- Link fixed in summary short view mode
	- Character escape bug fixed
	- Language masks for easy adaption of the language set
	- Language selection override from admin menu


09/11/2002 Version 1.7 prerelease 2 (clean installs only, do not upgrade!)

	- Everything from 1.7pre1 
	- Support for custom entity fields (!)
	- Language selection override from admin menu
	- Enhanched translation module

20/10/2002 Version 1.7 prerelease 1 (clean installs only, do not upgrade!)
    
	- Multilingual support
	- Translation module 
	- Extended PDF support
	- Enhanched navigation

26/08/2002 Version 1.6 stable (major issues included)
    
	- Fixed to-complex-to-mention bug in users.php
	- Fixed a bug in edit.php. When typing a category name with a single quote (') in it, the SQL 
	  query returned an error. I forgot to escape it.
	- I Visio'd a diagram to explain how the user thing works. Available at http://www.it-combine.com/crm
	- Added PDF report support for several functions. You can get a PDF summary of an entity, and you can
	  download the management information in PDF-format. 
	- A simple but very efficient phonebook was implemented. It can also be exported to PDF.

	- IT IS RECOMMENDED that you install this version 'clean' e.g. do not upgrade an older version. The install
	  procedure however SHOULD handle an upgrade quite well, though it was never thoroughly tested.
	
14/08/2002 Version 1.6 (pre-release) (major issues included)

	- Instead of the C | E | A | D links, there is now a pop-up quickmenu. This works much better, 
	  though it probably limits the number of browsers in which this works. This hasn't been 
	  tested yet, though
	- Adjusted the colors to more readable values
	- Added a config option for a login message which will be displayed when a user logs in
	- Dramatically improved the log routine. User adds, edits and modifications will now also be 
	  logged. Every click a user makes was already logged, though from now on the used account 
	  name is also saved to the database
	- The upgrade procedure handles the database changes 
	- Added the option to grant administrator priviledges to a login account. The user who owns 
	  such an account will not be promped for a password when entering the 'Administration'-section
	- MAJOR:
	
	    - Limited login accounts now MUST be named after a username which resides in the main
	      users table. When a limited login account is created for a perticular user, the name
	      of this user cannot be changed in the main users list untill the limited account is 
	      deleted.
	    
	    - When logging on as a limited user, you are no longer prompted to select your name from the 
	      presented list of NON-..-members. Instead, limited accounts, as discribed ealier, MUST MATCH
	      wich a user in the main user list (or: a user to whom entities can be assigned).
	      The limited user will immediately see his or her open 
	      entities after logging on. The possibility of marking a user as a member now is useless, and
	      therefore removed.
	    
	    These 2 points mark the completion of the user-thing makeover. The user administration is now
	    almost 100% the same as you're used to in most applications.


10/07/2002 Version 1.5f

	- Fixed a bug in the duedate-notify script. It had a hard-coded testsite URL in it.
	- Fixed a bug in the calendar. It generated 2 warnings when showing a month in the next year.
	
02/07/2002 Version 1.5e

	- Fixed a little summary bug in the statistics code.
	- Removed the outdated manual

29/06/2002 Version 1.5d
	
	- Changed database structure for CRMloginusers.password from "NOT NULL default ''" to 
	  "default NULL" hoping to solvee the "Column password cannot be NULL" problem
	- Increased the dimensions of the TEXTAREA used when editing an entity
	- Added a config option for the auto-logoff-timeout
	- Completed work on auto-appearing calendar. One can only insert a date using the calendar,

When upgrading: version 1.5d comes with an added config option - see the UPGRADING in the tarball for details

18/06/2002 Version 1.5c

	- Revised date validation (worked only on IE, now in all browsers)
	  Thanks to David Blandel
	- Fixed little bug with [alarm settings] also showing when adding a new enitity. This is illegal
	  because an alarm is connected to an enitity by its entity id, which is not yet set when adding
	  a new one.

15/06/2002 Version 1.5b

	- Added date validation to "Due date" and "Alarm date" forms
	- Added the option to try to write the config file from within the installer procedure.

	- Site statistics code fixes
	- Some grammar fixes

When upgrading: version 1.4a comes with a little database structure change!

11/06/2002 Version 1.3d
