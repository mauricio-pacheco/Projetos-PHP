CRM [ http://www.crm-ctt.com - hidde AT it DASH combine DOT com ]

Current version is 3.4.2 - Current database version is 3.4.2

-> You need at least MySQL version 4.1 to use CRM-CTT!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (for upgrading see the UPGRADING file)

1. Copy all files to a webserver-accessible directory, e.g. http://yoursite.com/crm/.

1a. (optional) For easy installation, typ "chmod 777 config.inc.php" in your installation directory.

2. Point your browser to the installation directory and follow the installation instructions.

2a. (if you did 1a) do a "chmod 755 config.inc.php" in your installation directory. (and a chown if you like)

3. Add a cron job to some machine (could be local, but also remote) to start the email-notifier for entities:

	An example from my cron file: (the cron user doesn't need to be root)
	
	# CRM Alarm date manager
	0 8 * * *       wget http://yoursite.com/crm/duedate-notify-cron.php?password=yourCRONpwd\&reposnr=XXX 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null
	0 15 * * *      wget http://yoursite.com/crm/duedate-notify-cron.php?password=yourCRONpwd\&reposnr=XXX 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null

	This will send an e-mail notification at 8 AM and 3 PM. Entities wich will be mentioned are entities which have
	an alarm date set to `today`.

	The reposnr=XXX part resembles the repository number you'd like to send notifications for. reposnr=0 for the first, 
	reposnr=1 for the second and so on (equal to the values in your config file).

	Skip the "1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null" part if you'd like reports mailed to the user under which the crond job runs.

	You can edit the cron script password using the administration interface (change system values, cronpassword). It is 
	recommended you change this password regularly for it is transmitted in plain text.

	Try the wget (or lynx --source) command first from the command line! It'll give nice output so you'll see if it all works.

6. Use the 'Change system values' option to set a global admin password (admpassword)

7. READ THE ADMINISTRATION MANUAL! There are some variables which you must set!

8. If the directory webdav_fs/ is not writeable by the webserver (the installation procedure mentions this)
   you will have to change the owner of the directory, e.g. "chown apache.apache webdav_fs/" and, to prevent
   other users from accessing it, issue a "chmod 700 webdav_fs/". I have no clue how to do this on Windows,
   but on the other hand, knowing Windows security is not that good, it will probably work out of the box.

9. Done. All settings can be modified using the 'administration' page.

TROUBLESHOOTING / FAQ

There are a few known troubles which you can take a shot at:

- I see warnings like "Notice: Undefined variable: step in ..." 

	The notices about undefined variables are there because you have a rather new version of PHP, which has a 
	high verbosity level by default, which in your case is probably set to 'notice' instead of 'error'. If you modify your 
	php.ini and set the notify level to 'errors only' (or something like that) this problem is gone. PHP 
	can handle undefined variables very well, and I don't get why the latest versions they released have set 
	the notification standard to such a verbose level.

- When I click the "Go to step 1" button it seems to just refresh the install.php browser screen and go no further.

	This issue is due to another PHP (php.ini) related problem when using one of the latest releases of PHP. 
	Just set the REGISTER_GLOBALS variable in your php.ini to 'yes' and this problem is solved.
