NET2FTP INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To view the detailed installation instructions, open the help.html file in a 
browser, and click on Administrator.

In a few words:
1 - Unzip all the files on your computer, and upload them to your server.
2 - The /temp directory should be chmodded to 777. 
3 - Set your settings in the settings.inc.php file. 
4 - A database is only required if you want to log the actions of the users.
To create the tables, execute the SQL queries in the "create_tables.sql" file. 
This can be done easily in PhpMyAdmin, the popular front-end to MySQL.
