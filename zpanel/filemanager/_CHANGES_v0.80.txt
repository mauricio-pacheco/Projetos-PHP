January 2004: version 0.80
==========================

----------
net2ftp version 0.80 contains:
- htmlarea version 2.0.3
- pclzip version 2.1
- pcltar version 1.3
- Everaldo's Crystal icons
----------

A new version with lots of additional features:

* Directories, files and symlinks are shown together and can be manipulated
  together

* The size taken by directories and files can be calculated; the directories
  are processed recursively.

* Directories and files can be searched for a word; the directories
  are processed recursively.

* The upload-and-unzip function works now even if the Zip module of PHP is not 
  installed, thanks to the pclzip library (see /includes/pclzip.lib.php). 

* The upload-and-unzip function works now also for Tar archives, thanks to the
  pcltar library (see /includes/pcltar.lib.php).

* When uploading files, a popup message appears to tell: 1- to be patient and
  2- that if the upload takes more than x seconds, it will be halted and he'll
  have to try again with less/smaller files.

* Functions which are not yet totally implemented can be turned on or off in
  settings.inc.php.

* If you don't know which function generates a particular output, you can turn a 
  setting on in settings.inc.php, then extra hidden HTML tags will be added 
  by each function.

* There are 2 troubleshooting functions: one to troubleshoot net2ftp on a
  webserver, and another one to troubleshoot an FTP server.

* While the script is executed, the status is displayed on top of the page.

* Selected rows have another background color

* The number of settings in settings.inc.php have been reduced
  to make net2ftp easier to configure. Some were not really used.

* When logging in the passive mode can be set

* The cookies set by net2ftp can be cleared from the login page

* The list of directories and files can be sorted based on the filename, size,
  modification time, etc

* Version checking script can automatically check if a new version of net2ftp
  exists

* Added support for Lycos Tripod and Earthlink, so that the Open link would work
  on the Browse page (printURL() function in browse.inc.php).

* New 16x16 icons which take less space and look nicer

* All icons are .png; workaround applied for IE which does not display 
  transparent png images nicely by default

* New onMouseOver effect for the action icons

* Bugfix: when the login directory was "" the user was directed to the root
  directory instead of his home directory

* Bugfix: when a file was downloaded, the filename was appended by ".txt" 
  and a line was added at the end of the file (reported by Jean-Pierre and
  corrected by Slynderdale)

* Bugfix: files with a filename which starts with a dot are transferred 
  using the FTP_ASCII mode


September 2003: version 0.73
============================

* Two of Slynderdale's add-ons are now integrated in the main release: 
  - the directory can be set on the login page
  - there is an anonymous login checkbox on the login page. (Last minute note:
    this one is included but put in comment, because there is a small bug that
    I couldn't solve.)

* A default directory can be specified in the settings.inc.php file.

* Bugfix: . and .. entries are removed now

* Bugfix: ftp_zipdirectory bug is fixed


September 2003: version 0.72
============================

* Added flush() in functions that can take some time (copy/move/delete and 
  upload) so that the intermediate results would be shown on screen 
  immediately.

* Help guide in HTML

* Added a shutdown function to display a warning and delete temporary files
  when the script reaches the maximum execution time and is stopped

* Small cosmetic changes to the layout

* Bugfix: when doing an upload-and-unzip of 1 or more archives, it was 
  necessary to also provide a normal file to upload.

* Bugfix: the link to the icons of video and wav files were broken.

* Bugfix: when the email could not be sent, the temporary file was not deleted.

August 2003: version 0.71
=========================

* Bugfix: the /temp directory was getting full of temporary files that were
  not deleted in case of error.

* The /icons directory is renamed to /images.


July 2003: version 0.7
=======================

* New layout and new icons

* Email directories and files using a zip file attachment

* If a subdirectory does not exist, the user is redirected to the root directory

* Small bugfixes


June 25, 2003: build 0030
=========================

Developers release.

* Better scanning of the ftp_rawlist output generated by the FTP server 
  See file browse.inc.php, function ftp_scanline().
  Two major changes here: 
    1- instead of listing the allowed characters in the regular expression, 
       it works the other way around: the unwanted characters are listed.
    2- if the scanning does not work, net2ftp tries again with a less
       strict scanning method, and in the end, if a line is still not work,
       the original raw list string is shown on the browse page.

* When ftp_chdir returns false, no error message is printed.
  See browse.inc.php, function ftp_getlist.
  Some FTP servers seem to return FALSE even if the directory exists...(right?)

* Some small changes in cleanDirectory(), glueDirectories() etc
  See filesystem.inc.php.
  All directories should be in the format /dir/subdir (leading / and no trailing /).
  The root directory is /. Only in ftp_getlist, a directory "" can be used.

* A small text is added on the Upload screen, to explain to webmasters where the
  upload-unzip feature should be, once the zip module of PHP is installed.
  (Note: Slynderdale is working on a version which would not need this module.)

* A .htaccess file is added, to handle HTTP errors.
  The drawback of this file is that the path should be edited. I am still
  looking for a better solution.


June 7, 2003: version 0.61
==========================

Minor bugfix release:

* Some FTP servers (Windows) do not accept ftp_chmod commands when there is a 
  leading slash in the directory name.


May 2003: version 0.6
=====================

This release is the first to contain code contributed by Slynderdale: the zip 
download of files, the WYSIWYG edit form (only for Internet Explorer 5.5 or 
higher), the listing of directories.

New features:

* Zip download of directories and files. 

* Zip upload; the files are decompressed on the web server, and transferred to 
  the FTP server.

* WYSIWYG form can be used to edit text files, when the browser is IE 5.5 or 6.0.

* Most pages can be bookmarked. When a bookmark is used to access a net2ftp page,
  a popup window asks for the username/password to be used on that FTP server. The
  password is not saved in the bookmark.

* On most pages where a directory can be entered, a "List" link opens a popup
  window which allows to browse through the directory structure and choose a
  directory.

* Authorization check on FTP server port. The admin can set authorized ports to ALL
  or to a certain port nr. In this last case, the port nr textbox is suppressed from
  the login page.

* Upload page: it is possible to enter another directory on the first page, and 
  to to upload another 5 files from the upload result page.

* The nr of files that can be uploaded at once can be set in settings.inc.php.

* The location of net2ftp on the server is determined automatically; there
  is no need to enter it in settings.inc.php any more.

* A check is made to see if the FTP module of PHP is installed.
  The modules needed for zip upload (Zip and Zlib) are optional. If they are
  not installed, the extra buttons and textboxes are suppressed.

* New functionality on the administrator page

Bugfixes:

* Some FTP servers do not show hidden files by default.
  By using the -a option those files are now shown. 

* Some FTP servers return fake directory entries "." and ".." which caused
  infinite loops in the copy/move/delete functions. These entries are now
  filtered out.

* There was a problem with javascript on the Browse page, if a directory or 
  filename contained a single quote. This is solved now.

* The directories and files are shown when connecting to the AS400 FTP server.


March 2003: version 0.5
=======================

New features:

* The directory that was last used, is saved in the cookie; when logging in
  later on, that directory is used. If the directory has been deleted in the 
  meanwhile, an error message is shown, and the cookie information is reset.

* Some of the layout settings which were coded on server side in 
  settings.inc.php and in the browse/edit/... functions have been replaced by 
  styles in the css files

* The HTML that is generated is now valid HTML 4.01 Transitional, or almost.
  (There are some features that most browsers can handle, but which are not
  foreseen in the standard, such as the wrap attribute of a textarea, used
  when editing text files.)


Bugfixes:

* When logging in for the first time, the directory is "/" instead of "".
  On certain FTP servers, entering "" would bring a user to its home directory 
  (for example /home/user) instead of the document root. Then, when clicking 
  on a subdirectory link (for example /subdir), net2ftp would assume this 
  subdirectory to be /subdir, whereas in fact it would be /home/user/subdir

* In browse(), ftp_chdir is now always executed; before, it was not executed if 
  the directory was ""

* When sending feedback via the form, single quotes were escaped (' became /'). 
  This is corrected.

* The layout has been adapted a little in most action (rename, chmod,...) screens: 
  the text is now aligned 50 px from the left border, instead of in the middle.


February 2003: version 0.4
==========================

Following the feedback of some users, here are the bugfixes:

* Function fopen is now used with the "b" option, which is (only) useful on Windows 
  servers

* The deletion of directories is now done with ftp_rmdir instead of ftp_delete

* The file layout_server.inc.php is merged in settings.inc.php

* All the arrays are now used with ['string'] instead of [string], as 
  recommended in the manual

* In the INSTALL file is now pointed out how to change the appearance of the
  login screen

* The database use is now by default set to no, to make the install easier.

February 2003: version 0.3
==========================

This version contains new features, and bug fixes.

New features:

* Copy and move files to a SECOND FTP server! This is handy for developers, 
who develop and test on a different environment than the production environment.

* If you change $myname and $mydomain in the settings.inc.php file, the layout 
of the login page is different from what is on net2ftp.com.

* If the security settings (in settings.inc.php) are set to restrict the access 
to some FTP servers only, this is reflected on the login page.


Bug fixes:

* Check the authorization only if $check_authorization is set to yes in 
settings.inc.php.

* The nr of lines in the edit form is reduced from 37 to 35 in 
layout_server.inc.php, because in Mozilla based browsers each line is a little 
taller than in IE.

* After doing some tests on different public FTP servers, it appears that they
reply differently to the ftp_rawlist request -- thanks to Ondrej for reporting 
this.
     - some FTP servers, like ftp.belnet.be, start with a line summarizing how 
       many subdirectories and files there are in the current directory. The 
       real list of subdirectories and files starts on the second line. This 
       worked well in net2ftp.

              [0] => total 15
              [1] => drwxr-xr-x 11 BELNET Archive 512 Feb 6 2000 BELNET
              [2] => drwxr-xr-x 2 BELNET Archive 512 Oct 29 2001 FVD-SFI

     - some other FTP servers, like ftp.redhat.com/pub, start directly with the 
       list of subdirectories and files. The first entry is omitted in net2ftp, 
       because it was assumed the first line would be used for the summary.

              [0] => drwxr-xr-x 9 ftp ftp 4096 Jan 11 06:34 contrib
              [1] => drwxr-xr-x 13 ftp ftp 4096 Jan 29 21:59 redhat
              [2] => drwxrwsr-x 6 ftp ftp 4096 Jun 05 2002 up2date


February 2003: version 0.2
==========================

This version is mainly released to make the application work with PHP > 4.0.6 
and with register_globals set to off.

* There is a new file: registerglobals.inc.php; this is to make the application 
work, even if register_globals is set to off.

* The ftp_close function has been renamed to ftp_closeconnection, so that the 
application would work with PHP > 4.0.6. Note that now, ftp_quit does not 
return TRUE or FALSE any more

* The ftp_get and ftp_put functions must now take FTP_ASCII and FTP_BINARY 
without the double quotes. In PHP 4.0.6 it was assumed that with the double 
quotes, FTP_ASCII was meant.

* The HTML layout has been modified a little, there are 2 different CSS 
templates.

* The file upload function has been modified (better error handling, if the 
temp directory has not been chmodded during the installation, or if no files 
are supplied).

* It is possible to use net2ftp without a database. The use_database setting 
is now taken into account. 



January 2003: version 0.1 - first release for developers
========================================================

* Since this is the first version, everything is new !
