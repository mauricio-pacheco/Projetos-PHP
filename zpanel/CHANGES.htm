<p><strong>[v 2.0]</strong></p>
<p>This list is partial because we didn't log every single fix or enhancement.</p>
<p>*Fixed a lot of the minor bugs</p>
<p>*Installed private messaging</p>
<p>*Updating the billing page to a better design</p>
<p>*Installed the ability to use templates (an example/tutorial is in templates/ZPanelV2)</p>
<p>*Added a Mass Mailing feature for admins</p>
<p>*Added an ability for users to change certain aspects of their profile</p>
<p>*Moved the installers to the installers/ folder like they were supposed to 
  be</p>
<p>*Updated all of the installers to their newest versions. (ie. phpNuke 7.2)</p>
<p>*Ported all of the text into a language file. The english language file can 
  be found at zpanel/languages/english.php</p>
<p><strong>[v 1.5.1]</strong></p>
<p>*Fixed &quot;Local path to ZPanel&quot; not showing up in the Administration 
  page. </p>
<p>*Fixed a couple of bugs in the Administration page</p>
<p>*Added an update feature so hosts don't have to re-enter their users. (example 
  in the readme)</p>
<p><strong>[v 1.5]</strong></p>
<p>*Fixed many errors that didn't effect function. Just wanted to make it look 
  cleaner if you have display_errors set to 'on' in your php.ini</p>
<p>*Fixed the &quot;Web Service&quot; drop down when adding a new user. Now it 
  correctly displays all of the services.</p>
<p>*Added an easy mysql injection page into the installer so you don't have to 
  load the database tables using the .sql file. Just trying to make it easier 
  for you!</p>
<p>*By request, you can specify the URL for each user. In case you don't provide 
  them with subdomains.</p>
<p>*Upgraded the filemanager. Fixed filemanager &quot;not allowed ftp server&quot; 
  issue.</p>
<p>*Hid the filemanager icon from IIS hosts. (IIS for some reason won't understand 
  my code and keeps displaying no directories/files.)</p>
