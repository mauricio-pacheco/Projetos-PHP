	We request you retain the full copyright notice below including the link to www.phpbb.com.
	This not only gives respect to the large amount of time given freely by the developers
	but also helps build interest, traffic and use of phpBB 2.0. If you cannot (for good
	reason) retain the full copyright we request you at least leave in place the 
	Powered by phpBB {PHPBB_VERSION} line, with phpBB linked to www.phpbb.com. If you refuse
	to include even this then support on our forums may be affected.

	Do not remove my copyright link unless you made huge changes to theme (adding some mods
	or changing few colors or images is a tiny change). If you have any questions contact info
	is on my web site.
