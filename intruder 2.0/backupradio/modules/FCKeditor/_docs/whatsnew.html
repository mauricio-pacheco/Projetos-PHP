					target="_blank">SF Feature-1063217</a>] The new advanced&nbsp;<strong>Style</strong>
			command is available in the toolbar: full preview, context sensitive, style 
			definitions are loaded from a XML file (see documentation for more 
			instructions).
			<li>
				The <strong>Font Format</strong>, <strong>Font Name</strong> and <strong>Font Size</strong>
				toolbar command now show a <strong>preview</strong>
			of the available options.
			<li>
				The new <strong>Find</strong> and <strong>Replace</strong>
			features has been introduced.
			<li>

			system has been developed. Now it is quite easy to customize the editor to your 
			needs. (Take a look at the html/sample06.html file).
			<li>
				The editor now handles <strong>HTML entities</strong>
			in the right way (XHTML support must be set to "true"). It handles all entities 
			defined in the W3C&nbsp;XHTML DTD file.
			<li>
				A new "_docs" folder has been introduced for the <strong>documentation</strong>. 
			It is not yet complete, but I hope the community will help us to fill it 
			better.
			<li>
			It is now possible (even if it is not recommended by the W3C) to force the use 
			of simple ampersands (&amp;) on attributes (like the links href) instead of its 
			entity &amp;amp;. Just set FCKConfig.ForceSimpleAmpersand = true in 
			the&nbsp;configuration file.

			The editing area is not anymore clipped if the toolbar is too large and exceeds 
			the window width.

					target="_blank">SF BUG-1027858</a>] Firefox 1.0 
			PR&nbsp;introduced&nbsp;a bug that made the editor stop working on it. A 
			workaround has been developed to fix the problem.

			corrected.
