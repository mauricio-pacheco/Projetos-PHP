		<H1>Localization (Interface Translation)</H1>
		<P>The languages files must be created inside the "editor/lang" directory of the 
			project. You can use the file <STRONG>en.js</STRONG> as the base file for your 
			translations. The file names respect the <A href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3066.html" target="_blank">
				RFC 3066</A> <STRONG></STRONG>standards (but in lowercase). So, for 
			example, a file for the <STRONG>Portuguese language</STRONG> should be called <STRONG>pt.js</STRONG>.</P>
		<P>Translation could also be localized for a specific country. In this case, for 
			example, a Brazilian Portuguese translation file should be called <STRONG>pt-br.js</STRONG>.</P>
		<P>The clients language auto detection system uses the first available language 
			that best fits the client settings. For example, if a client computer is set to 
			Brazilian Portuguese and there is no pt-br.js file available, the pt.js is used 
			if available. If not, the default language is used (from the&nbsp;configuration 
			file).</P>
		<P>When creating new language files, you need to add an entry for it in the 
			"edit/lang/fcklanguagemanager.js" file. Something like this:<BR>
			<BR>
			<code>FCKLanguageManager.AvailableLanguages =
				<BR>
				{<br>
				<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px">
					en : 'English',<BR>
					<STRONG>pt : 'Portuguese'</STRONG> </BLOCKQUOTE>}
				<BR>
			</code>
			<BR>
			An important thing is to save the files in a <STRONG>UTF-8</STRONG>
		encoded format. In other case, some strange characters could appear instead of 
		some special chars, like accented letters, symbols, etc.
		<P></P>
		<P>All translated files must be sent by e-mail to <A href="mailto:fredck@fckeditor.net">
				fredck@fckeditor.net</A>. Before starting a new translation is a good 
			practice to contact FredCK (using the same address) asking if the translation 
			was not yet started by another person.
		</P>
