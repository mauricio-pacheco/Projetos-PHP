Upgrading from CRM 3.1.0 to 3.2.0

Note!!

- This upgrade routine executes a *large* number of heavy database queries. This is
purely housekeeping; lots of obsolete indices are deleted and new ones are created. 
On large databases, this will take a long a time. 

1. Backup your CRM directory and your database
2. Unpack crm-ctt-3.2.0
3. Copy your old config file over the empty distributed one
4. Point your browser to http://yoursite/your/upgrade.php and follow instructions

Upgrading from CRM 3.0.0 to 3.1.0

1. Backup your CRM directory and your database
2. Unpack crm-ctt-3.1.0
3. Copy your old config file over the empty distributed one
4. Point your browser to http://yoursite/your/upgrade.php and follow instructions
5. You're done
6. Re-set your required default fields (if you had any) for those 3 settings will be lost.

Upgrading from CRM 2.6.2 to 3.0.0

	Warning: this version implements a complete new way of managing extra fields. This
	affects the user experience, and the upgrade routine is pretty heavy. It will take 
	care of all conversions to be done. The way it's implemented now makes CRM-CTT much 
	more flexible for future enhanchements. 

	Before upgrading, please check your unreferenced extra fields. After upgrading, fields
	which are already unreferenced in your current 2.6.2 installation cannot be restored. To
	avoid this, restore your unreferenced fields before upgrading, and delete them again
	afterwards.

	Because of the extra field change, you will have to edit all templates which use extra 
	field values because the reference will be changed. Also, you'll need to re-set your
	main entity and customer list layout (if you had any extra fields in it)

More than for the "normal" upgrades, point 1 of the list counts!

   your ex-1.9.2 CRM installations, e.g. if you had a config file like this: (yes! ASCII art!)

	----%<---------- config.inc.php -------------------
	|						  |
	|	$host[0] = "dbserver";			  |
	|	$user[0] = "root";			  |
	|	$pass[0] = "password";			  |
	|	$database[0] = "CRM_DEP_A";		  |
        |						  |
	|	$host[1] = "dbserver";			  |
	|	$user[1] = "root";			  |
	|	$pass[1] = "password";			  |
	|	$database[1] = "CRM_DEP_B";		  |
	|						  |
	---->%---------- /config.inc.php ------------------

   Modify it to this:	

	----%<---------- config.inc.php -------------------
	|						  |
	|	$host[0] = "dbserver";			  |
	|	$user[0] = "root";			  |
	|	$pass[0] = "password";			  |
	|	$database[0] = "CRM_DEP_A";		  |
	|	$table_prefix[0] = "CRM";		  |
	|						  |
	|	$host[1] = "dbserver";			  |
	|	$user[1] = "root";			  |
	|	$pass[1] = "password";			  |
	|	$database[1] = "CRM_DEP_B";		  |
	|	$table_prefix[1] = "CRM";		  |
	|						  |
	---->%---------- /config.inc.php ------------------
   
   If you don't do this, CRM will assume the table prefix being CRM for all
   repositories which do not have these variables specified. The admin section
   will generate an error, though everything will work. Nevertheless, it is
   recommended you adjust your config file.

Upgrading from CRM 1.7(a|b|c|d) to 1.8(..preX)

-- It is generally not recommended to upgrade from 1.7() to 1.8. If you do want to, read the following
or send me an e-mail.

Execute the following statement in your CRM MySQL installation:

ALTER TABLE `CRMloginusers` ADD `FULLNAME` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL, ADD `EMAIL` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL, ADD `CLLEVEL` ENUM('ro','rw','ooro','oorw') NOT NULL; 

Upgrading from CRM 1.7c to 1.7d

A configuration option was added. When upgrading, please issue to following SQL statement
to your MySQL installation:

    INSERT INTO `CRMsettings` (`settingid`, `setting`, `value`, `datetime`, `discription`) VALUES ('', 'MonthsToShow', '7', NOW(), 'The number of months to show in the various calendar appearances.')

And an option to log file owners when adding a file was added for which you need to execute the following statement:

    ALTER TABLE `CRMbinfiles` ADD `username` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL;  
    
For questions (or if you need a script to do this for you) please mail me.

Upgrading from CRM 1.7(a|b) to 1.7c (do not upgrade from 1.7 to 1.7c!)

Backup you config.inc.php. Untar all installation files over the old files in your CRM in-
stallation directory. When, copy back your config.inc.php file and you're all set.

Upgrading from CRM 1.7(a) to 1.7b

Just copy the csv.php file from the 1.7b distribution over the old one. 

Upgrading from CRM 1.7 to 1.7a

CRM 1.7a using a new way to encrypt it's passwords. Do not attempt to upgrade. If you still do,
consider only replacing auth3.inc.php and emptying all your password in the CRMloginusers table.

Upgrading from CRM =< 1.6 to CRM >= 1.7

As also stated in the CHANGELOG, 1.7 can not be installed over a previous version.(unless it is VERY urgent)

Upgrading from CRM =< 1.6 to 1.7pre1 or 1.7pre2

As also stated in the CHANGELOG, 1.7 can not be installed over a previous version.

Upgrading from CRM 1.5x to 1.6

CRM 1.6 comes with a minor database structure update. A field must be added
to the CRMuselog table, and to the CRMloginusers table. This is all handled 
by the upgrade procedure.

Upgrading from CRM 1.5e to 1.5f

No installation issues. Unpack the 1.5f tarball over your old installation directory, but
make sure you back up your config.inc.php file first. 

Upgrading from CRM 1.5d to 1.5e

No installation issues. Unpack the 1.5e tarball over your old installation directory, but
make sure you back up your config.inc.php file first. Afterwards, remove the remaining manual.php file.

Upgrading from CRM =< 1.5c to 1.5d

- You'll have to execute an SQL statement using your MySQL console, or a tool like PHPMyAdmin. The
query is:

INSERT INTO CRMsettings VALUES (9, 'timeout','20','','Number of minutes before a user is automatically logged off when there is no activity');

This will add the 'timeout' config setting to the database. It will automatically appear in you
administration interface.
