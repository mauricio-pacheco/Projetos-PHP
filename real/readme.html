<h3>OpenRealty 3.0 </h3>
<p>by Jon Roig (jon@jonroig.com)<br>
Release 7-1-2002
</p>

<p>
<b>LATEST VERSION:</b><br>
<a href="http://jonroig.com/freecode/openrealty/">http://jonroig.com/freecode/openrealty/</a>
<p>

<h3>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE FILE BEFORE INSTALLING OPENREALTY</h3>
<p>
(Thus, you will avoid my wrath when you ask a question answered in this FAQ)
</p>
<h3>Support and News</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://jonroig.com/freecode/phpBB/">http://jonroig.com/freecode/phpBB/</a><br>
<p>
<b>I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS VIA EMAIL!</b> Please post all comments, questions, etc... to the message board and I will respond as quickly as possible.
Also, you might try reading through the posts -- your question may be answered already.
</p>
<p>
I do, however, have time for consulting gigs from time to time. If you need a hand with customization or installs, feel free
to drop me an email at <a href="mailto:jon@jonroig.com">jon@jonroig.com</a>. I think you'll find my rates are
reasonable and that I'm an easy guy to work with...
</p>

<h3>This is Free?</h3>
<p>
OpenRealty is 100% free. You will never be charged a cent to use it and there are no restrictions on its use. There are no hidden catches -- 
all we ask is that you leave the hidden comment in that appears on every page generated
by OpenRealty intact. This is my calling card, so it's very important to me that I get recognition
for my work.
</p>
<p>This is a fun project to work on. I enjoy it. Frankly,
I get a kick out of seeing sites all over the world running my script. A strange hobby, maybe...
but one has to do something during the hours away from work. ('Sides, the chicks LOVE it)
</p>
<p>
If you want to contribute to the project, there are several ways you can do so:
<ul>
	<li> Find bugs and report them on <a href="http://jonroig.com/freecode/phpBB/">the forums</a>!
	<li> Hack code! Got an improvement? Share it with the rest of the world (literally).
	<li> Translate the english.php include file to your native tongue -- post on the forums if you
	can help with this.
	<li> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/M20P6BE4B4CM/ref%3Dcm%5Fwed%5Fsearch%5Fregistry/102-0546019-6714514">Purchase 
	something off my Amazon wedding registry</a>. Like I said, the chicks love open source programmers, 
	but sometimes my fiance can't understand why I forgo sleep to work on this. Bribe her with stuff
	and she'll let me work more. :)
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Using and Installing OpenRealty</h3>

<ol>
	<li> Download OpenRealty. Unzip the file.
	<li> Create a new folder on your server.
	<li> Configure and set parameters (explained below).
	<li> Upload the contents of the zip file to your server.
	<li> Create and configure your database tables (also explained below).
	<li> Go on to live a healthy, happy, real-estate driven life...
</ol>


<h3>Required to run Openrealty</h3>
<ol>
	<li> MySQL or another database
	<li> PHP 4 or better
</ol>

<h3>Summary of Functionality</h3>
<p>
This system is intended to become a toolkit for listings sites. Whether you're listing
real estate, autos, penpals, or churches, this tool should help you along your way.
Here's a basic overview of the functionality.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Allows visitors to look through your real estate listings 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365.25 days a year.
	<li>Easily keep your property listings updated -- no HTML coding required to add, delete, or modify listings.
	<li>Built-in image manager -- upload photos via your web browser, either when creating new listings or modifying an existing one. If photos are not uploaded for a property, a &quot;photo not available&quot; image will be automatically displayed for the listing.
	<li>Automatically thumbnails -- smaller versions of your images are automatically created through the GD library.
	<li>Automagically interfaces with Yahoo Maps -- potential customers will always know exactly where to find your property.
	<li>Flexible database backend -- compatible with mysql, oracle, microsoft SQL, etc... through the ADODB abstraction layer.
	<li>Secure -- no one but you can change your listings.
	<li>Viral Marketing -- visitors can email listings to their friends right from OpenRealty.
	<li>Easy to install -- just edit a single configuration file.
	<li>Showcase specific properties -- built-in featured listing manager allows you to place special offerings right on your front page.
	<li>Flexible search -- browse properties according to whatever criteria you like.
	<li>Easy setup -- configurator tool makes OpenRealty 3.0 easy to install.
	<li>Configurable forms -- Don't like the form choices included in OpenRealty? Change them to meet your needs!
	<li>Template system -- produce a sophisticated site without any knowledge of PHP
	<li>Supports CSS stylesheets.
	<li>Multilanguage capable (coming soon -- I need help with translation!)
</ul>

<h4>Changes Since Last Version</h4>
<p>
This version of OpenRealty is a complete rewrite of the OpenRealty engine. Based on 
a system I wrote called OpenListings, this is the first use of my new listings engine.
Designed to be completely flexible, OpenListings allows you create fully featured listings sites for whatever
you want to put online, be it homes, or cars, or airplanes, or pets.
</p>
<p>
The changes are almost too numerous to mention -- templates, automatic thumbnailing of images, 
configurable forms, improved password handling, etc... the list goes on and on...
</p>
<p>
This should always be considered a work in progress. Spot a bug? Let us know in the <a href="http://jonroig.com/freecode/phpBB/">forums</a>.
It has been because of the community involvement of people all over the world that this project has
been as successful as it has.
</p>

<h3>Plans for next version</h3>
<ul>
	<li> XML/web services export/import
	<li> True, simultaneous multi-language capability.
	<li> "Notify me when a listing that contains XXX becomes available"
	<li> Paypal integration/more advanced moderation facilities
	<li> What else...? Let us know in <a href="http://jonroig.com/freecode/phpBB/">the forums</a>...
</ul>



<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
<li> Obviously, you've already unpacked the file, or you wouldn't be looking at this.
<li> You need to CHMOD the contents of the images folder to 777, including the listing_photos and user_photos
subfolders. This is where your images are stored.
<li> Edit the /include/common.php file. (More on this in a moment...)
<li> Set up a database that OpenRealty can use. (Again, see below...)
<li> Run the configurator. If everything goes alright, you should be able to log in:
<br>
Default login = admin
<br>
Default pass = password
<br><br>You should change this password ASAP.
</ol>

<h3>The common.php File</h3>
<p>In the include directory, you should find the common.php file. This file contains
all the settings for OpenRealty. Open it up with your favorite text editor and you should see a 
whole bunch of settings...
</p>
<p>For those of you who are new to the world of PHP, don't be scared. We could have put all 
these settings into a database or something, but we'd take a hit in performance with all
those extra queries...
</p>
<p>... and you like speed, don't you...?
</p>
<p>
Make a backup copy before you do anything drastic and maybe just adjust one thing at a time. Although each item has
an explanation next to it, I might be able to shed some additional light on how this works...
</p>
<p>
<b>SITE INFORMATION</b><br>
This area is where you set up the base info for your site. This includes information like your site's
address, the basepath (where the files are located on your server), your name, email address, and the site's
name. Make sure you leave the trailing slash off the basepath and url, or everything will get all messed up.
</p>
<p>The most common error has to do with the distinction between basepath and baseurl. The baseurl is the actual web
address that users see -- IE, http://jonroig.com/freecode/openrealty
</p>
<p>The basepath, however, is for your machine's use only -- it's the physical location of the openrealty
scripts on your box. You'll know instantly if you got it wrong, because it'll give you an error that looks like:<br>
Warning: Failed opening '/template/generic/style.php' for inclusion (include_path='') in /usr/www/users/linuxuser/openrealty/include/common.php on line 42 
</p>
<p>
Here's a little trick: in the example above, "/usr/www/users/linuxuser/openrealty" is the correct basepath. Make sense?
</p>

<p>
<b>DATABASE TYPE</b><br>
You may not have to set anything here -- it depends entirely on what kind of database you choose to use.
Because we're using the <a href="http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB">ADODB</a> database abstraction library,
you pretty much get your pick of databases. Nice, eh?
</p>
<p>
Possible choices are: access, ado, db2, ado_access, vfp, fbsql, ibase,firebird, borland_ibase, informix, mssql, mysql, mysqlt, maxsql, oci8,
oci8po, odbc, oracle, postgres, postgres7, sqlanywhere, sybase
</p>
<p>
It might be worth noting that we really haven't tried it too extensively with some of the more exotic databases out there... so if you're using anything
other than postgres, mysql, or mssql, let us know. I'd be curious to hear if you have any problems...
</p>
<p>
This is also where you set up your database user name, password, the db name, and the server to use.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>TEMPLATE DATA</b><br>
This is where you set up the path to the templates. Eventually, we hope to develop a wide variety of different 
styles that can just be dropped into place. For the initial release, I'm distributing one style. It's plain...
admitted rather boring... and we call it "generic."
</p>
<p>
Probably, you won't have to mess with these settings, at least at first. The template_path refers to the internal
server path to the folder, while template_url is for browsers to hit things like the CSS file. There's an
explanation of all the files later in the document.
</p>
<p>
If you do take it on yourself, make sure you leave the off the trailing slashes or everything will crash
and you will cry. (We'd rather have you crying tears of joy, rather than frustration.)
</p>

<p>
<b>LANGUAGE FILE PATH -- USED FOR MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT</b><br>
This distribution of OpenRealty contains only one language file, but we hope to make more available for download soon...
If you can help translate the english.php file, post a message on the forums (so people don't duplicate each other's work).
<p>
Ultimately, we hope to make OpenRealty as universal as we can... Also, as of right now, OR only supports
one language at a time (no multilingual sites), but that's something we'll improve on ASAP.
</p>

<p>
<b>DISPLAY SETTINGS</b><br>
European users rejoice! You can now change the money sign that appears by default. We also now support a wide
variety of numbering formats, designated by numbers you put in for the $config[number_format_style]
in the common.php file:
<ul>
<li> 1 - Good old American formatting -- 123,456.78 (for the blokes in the UK, too)
<li> 2 - Spain/Germany -- 123.456,78 
<li> 3 - Estonia -- 123 456.78
<li> 4 - France/Norway -- 123 456,78
<li> 5 - Switzerland -- 123'456.78
<li> 6 - Kazahistan -- 123 456-78
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Thanks, Satoko, for cluing me into the mysteries of the international numbering system.
</p>
<p>
Next up is the way that prices are displayed... since you've already set your money sign, there's 
a little function called "money_format" that displays it properly. The default is the US/UK, but I've left
it open, so you can do whatever you need to do to make it work for your native land.
</p>


<p>
<b>UPLOAD SETTINGS</b><br>
OpenRealty now contains a thumbnailing engine that works with the GD library -- this is usually included
with most linux-based hosting plans, you never know. Windows users will probably have to change $config[make_thumbnail]
to "no". If you get a "undefined function: imagecreatefromjpeg()" error, then you know that you have to turn this option off.
</p>
<p>
Now I know what some of you are thinking... why GD? Why not imagemajick -- it can handles GIF files as
well as jpg and png. The reason is simple. I don't have it on my test machine. If someone wants to write
an imagemajick thumbnailler, let me know. It should be pretty straightforward, and it is something
I'd like to include.
</p>

<p>
<b>LISTING EXPIRATION SETTINGS</b><br>
You can now set up OpenRealty so that listings expire automatically after a set amount of time. The settings
should be pretty obvious.
</p>

<p>
<b>USER SETTINGS</b><br>
In an effort to give administrators more fine-grained control over OpenRealty, we developed a new
user settings area. You can make it so users can't sign up for the system -- instead, all new users
would have to be created through the administrative tool.
</p>
<p>
I also added a bunch of default privileges for new users. Maybe you want all the users to be able to view the logs
for some reason, I don't know... I figured it would be better to create the option than live a life of regretting
that I had not done so.
</p>

<p>
<b>MODERATION SETTINGS</b><br>
This is a popular one. OpenRealty now supports a moderated setting -- if you flip this on, listings will
require an administrator to flip them on. Inactive listings can be previewed by either the listing's creator
or an admin, but the general public will not be able to see them.
</p>
<p>
You can also set OpenRealty to email you when someone adds a new listing. This email will go to the address
you defined way back in the USER SETTINGS section.
</p>

<p>

<b>MISCELLENEOUS SETTINGS</b><br>
In general, you shouldn't have to mess with these files... If you don't know what they are, leave 'em alone.
</p>


<h3>Setting up the database</h3>
<p>
Due to OpenRealty's use of the <a href="http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB">ADODB Database Abstraction Layer</a>,
OpenRealty can support a wide variety of different databases. It cannot, however, create the database
for you. You must first create a database through your preferred method -- usually, this is something
like phpMyAdmin for folks with mysql or the enterprise manager for those of you blessed with
microsoft sql servers. Your mileage may vary -- my host, for instance, makes me use their tool to
add mysql. They're trying to limit me to a single mysql db.
</p>
<p>
For those power users out there, you actually have to grant OpenRealty the ability to create databases -- it uses
a temporary table to do the sorting on the listingssearch.php page.
</p>

<h3>The Files</h3>
<p>
What do all these files do... well... let me tell you about it.
</p>
<ul>

		</ul>
</ul>
		
		


<h3>Customizing OpenRealty</h3>
<p>
I've tried to document the code as much as possible to aid with customization... but 
most of what you're probably looking for will be in the /template/generic folder. The idea here 
is that you could distribute an entirely different system by only swapping out that folder.
</p>
<h4>Styles and Stylesheets</h4>
<p>
You can control a lot of the look and feel of the system through the info contained in the style.php
and style.css files. Editing them should be reasonably straightforward...
</p>

<h4>Form Setup</h4>
<p>
If you login as admin/password, you'll have access to the form editors. Please take a few 
moments to examine the example before you mess with it... but let me break it down
for you:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Field Name: The name of the field. Users won't see it, so keep it to a single word.
<li> Field Type: What type of field is it? You have the following choices:
<ul>
<li> Text -- Standard single line text input box.
<li> Textarea -- Multi line text input area.
<li> Select List -- Pulldown list
<li> Select Multiple -- Select where you can choose multiple items
<li> Option Box -- Radio buttons
<li> Check Box Divider -- List of items with checkboxes (like for features)
<li> Price -- Text-type input, but automatically formatted as $amount. (or whatever, you can
control this via the common.php file)
<li> URL -- Text-type input, but auto formats the <a href="http://jonroig.com">url</a>.
<li> Email -- Text-type input, but auto formats the <a href="mailto:jonroig.com">email address</a>.
<li> Number -- Text-type input, but auto formats the number to include commas
</ul>
<li> Required: Does the user have to fill this out to submit/update a listing? 
<li> Field Caption:  This is that the user sees next to the item
<li> Field Elements: What are the choices for select lists and option boxes? Separated with double bars like 
so: Alabama||Alaska||Arizona  
<li> Default Text:  Should the form have some pre-defined text in it when the form is first
viewed?
<li> Display Location: This corresponds with the built in template system. Where on 
the listingview.php page should this item appear? You have the following choices:
top_right, top_left, bottom_right, bottom_left, headline, center, feature1, feature2  
<li> Display When Browsing:  Choosing "yes" here will include this item as a column on
the search page. If the form item is a text area, then it'll display on it's own line on the search results page.
<li> Rank: The lower the rank, the closer to the top of the page it'll appear.
</ul>

<h4>Templates</h4>
<p>
To aid non-php-type folks, I've added a number of little functions to the 
/template/generic/style.php file. These are then called on the listingview.php 
userview.php pages as part of a kind of template system. This should not be considered 
finished -- I need to centralize it all a bit and add one or two more functions...
</p>
<p>The actual code for these functions is located in the /include/template/generic/style.php
file.
</p>
<p>
Let me run down the list of options -- you'll find examples of how to use these functions
in a given page's code:
</p>
<p>
In <b>Listingview.php</b> you can call the following functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>renderListingsImages($listingID)</b> This outputs the listing's
images in a vertical column.
<li> <b>renderSingleListingItem($listingID, $name)</b> Let's say you only want
to output a single item in a listing -- like, say, zip code or something.
You would do that like so: renderSingleListingItem($listingID, "zip")
<li> <b>renderSingleListingItemNoCaption($listingID, $name)</b> Like the example
above, but instead of outputing "Zip: 90210" it will simply output "90210"
<li> <b>renderSingleListingItemRaw($listingID, $name)</b> This is sort of like renderSingleListingItemNoCaption
except the script makes absolutely no effort to format the data being spit out. Handy if you 
have to plug a variable into a popup mortgage calculator, for instance.
<li> <b>renderTemplateArea($templateArea, $listingID)</b> Relates to the template system --
shows all the items for a given template area.
<li> <b>renderTemplateAreaNoCaption($templateArea, $listingID)</b>Same as above,
but without the corresponding captions.
<li> <b>getMainListingData($listingID)</b> Outputs the title of the listing
and the user who created it.
<li> <b>hitcount($listingID)</b> This allows you to add a hit counter to any listing.
<li> <b>renderUserInfoOnListingsPage($listingID)</b> Include information about the
user who created the listing.
<li> <b>getListingEmail($listingID)</b> Include the email address of the user who created the
listing.
<li> <b>makeYahooMap($listingID, $address_field, $city_field, $state_field)</b> Builds a link to
Yahoo maps. The various fields refer to the names of field setup through the template building tool.

</ul>

<p>
In <b>userview.php</b> you can call the following functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>renderUserImages($user)</b> Outputs a given user's images in a 
vertical column.
<li> <b>renderUserInfo($user)</b> Outputs the information attached to a user.
<li> <b>getMainUserData($user)</b> Shows the name of the user.
<li> <b>getUserEmail($user)</b> Shows the email address of the user.
</ul>

<p>
<b>listing_browse.php</b>, the main search page in the demo, has these functions to help you:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>browse_all_listings()</b> This simply outputs a link to browse all the listings
with the number of available listings. 
<li> <b>searchbox_select ($browse_caption, $browse_field_name)</b> Outputs a search multiple
select box containing the elements and caption of your choice. Should be contained within a 
table.
<li> <b>searchbox_select_vert ($browse_caption, $browse_field_name)</b> Just like searchbox_select,
except it doesn't need a table and the caption is located above the select box.
<li> <b>searchbox_pulldown ($browse_caption, $browse_field_name)</b> Same as above, but with a pulldown
menu. There's also a corresponding searchbox_pulldown_vert.
<li> <b>searchbox_checkbox ($browse_caption, $browse_field_name)</b> Sensing a trend here? This lets you
build a search box with checkboxes. You can also, by the way, use <b>searchbox_option ($browse_caption, $browse_field_name)</b>
if you want radio buttons. For that matter, there are also searchbox_checkbox_vert and searchbox_option_vert functions, too.
<li> <b>renderFeaturedListingsVertical($num_of_listings)</b> This displays however many featured listings you'd like in a vertical column. A horizontal version
will be in the next revision...
<li> <b>latestListings($num_of_listings)</b> This lists the latest X number of listings.
</ul>
<p>
By the way, you can add these functions anywhere. If you want to layout search boxes horizontally rather than vertically, just through a table
tag around each of the searchbox functions.
</p>
